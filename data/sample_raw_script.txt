== Prologue ==

<div align="center">''Once upon a time in New York City, there lived a community of fairy tale characters known as Fabletown. The Fables who live there arrived hundreds of years ago, after they were exiled from their Homelands.''</div>

<div align="center">-</div>

<div align="center">''Through the use of a magic spell called Glamour, they have protected their secret community from the mundane world.''</div>

<div align="center">-</div>

<div align="center">''Sheriff Bigby Wolf protects them from each other.''</div>


== New York ==

A man discusses the weather alongside shots of New York and Fabletown that are shown.

'''Radio Voice:''' ''(radio crackling)''...105 today again if you missed it, a record for the date: hottest ever in June. Uh, 103 now and that humidity looks low, but remember, the hotter the air is, the more moisture it can hold. So 103 with 31% humidity is a lot more humid than say, 73 with 31% humidity, and it is muggy out there.

The radio cuts out.

Sheriff [[Bigby Wolf (Video Game)|Bigby Wolf]] is seen in the backseat of a taxi, being driven to a building.

== Tenenment Building ==

''Tenement Building<br />South Bronx<br />Sometime after midnight...''

Bigby steps out of the vehicle and lights up a cigarette before entering a building indicated by a note. Once he enters, he spots a [[Mr. Toad (Video Game)|toad]] standing by the staircase.

'''Bigby:''' Mr. Toad...

'''Toad:''' Shit...Bigby! ''(nervously laughs)'' Listen, mate I-I know I don’t look human. It’s a problem, I get it, I just stepped outside the apartment for just a second to see what kind of damage this drunk shit is doing. Just cut me a break, yeah? I’ll get me glamour first thing in the morning. Cross my heart. No need to kick up a fuss.

<tabber>I’m looking at a 3 foot toad.=

'''Bigby:''' I’m looking at a 3 foot toad. In a sweater...That’s a problem.

|-|No harm done.=

'''Bigby:''' Look, no harm done...I’ll give you a pass, but listen...

|-|Enough excuses, Toad.=

'''Bigby:''' I’ve heard enough of your excuses, Toad. This is unacceptable.

|-|...=

'''Toad:''' Come on, Bigby...say something. You’re starting to scare me.

</tabber>

''Silence is a valid option.''

'''Bigby:''' If you can’t afford to look human, you’re going to [[The Farm]]. It’s as simple as that.

'''Toad:''' You can’t send me up to live with those animals...

Bigby smirks at him, highlighting the irony in that statement.

'''Toad:''' You know what I mean.

'''Bigby:''' Go see a witch. Get a glamour.

'''Toad:''' Bigby, they’re bleedin’ me dry, mate. The quality of the spell goes down, but the rates keep climbing up. Do you have any idea how much it costs to have an entire family in glamour?

A crash is heard from upstairs.

<tabber>I don’t make the rules.=

'''Bigby:''' I don’t make the rules. Sorry. I can’t give you a free pass on this, Toad. My hands are tied.<br />

''Mr. Toad will remember that.''<br />

'''Toad:''' Right. Right.<br />

'''Bigby:''' There’s too much at stake.

|-|Not my problem.=

'''Bigby:''' It’s not my problem. You’re the one risking your entire family getting shipped off. It’s completely irresponsible, Toad.<br />

''Mr. Toad will remember that.''<br />

'''Mr. Toad:''' Bigby, please...That’s a low blow, mate. All this’ll be taken care of as soon as the witches are available to cast a spell.

|-|Get it fixed.=

'''Bigby:''' Then get it fixed. It’s not complicated, Toad.

|-|...=

''Mr. Toad noticed your silence.''<br />

'''Toad:''' It’s not really even worth dwelling on at this point. You’re telling me to get it together. 

</tabber>

'''Bigby:''' Whatever it costs, it’s worth it. You don’t want me catching you out of glamour again.

{{#tag:tabber|(Bigby said to get it fixed)=

''Mr. Toad will remember that.''

A television crashes through the upstairs window and falls outside, behind Bigby.

'''Toad:''' Fuckin’ hell. See? This is what I called you about, Sheriff.

More commotion is heard upstairs.

'''Toad:''' You’re just gonna stand there? Do something, Bigby. Before he completely tears up the place.

<tabber>So what have I walked into?=

'''Bigby:''' So, what am I walking into exactly?<br />

'''Toad:''' [[The Woodsman (Video Game)|The Woodsman’s]] on another bender... He’s been going on like that for hours. Turn this place into dust if you let him. He’s in a fuckin’ rage.

{{#tag:tabber|Do it yourself.=

'''Bigby:''' You’re the landlord, Toad. This is something you should be doing.<br />

'''Toad:''' Oh, yeah, that’d be a fair fight. You’re the Sheriff, Bigby, and the man’s clearly disturbing the peace... or whatever a Mundy cop would call it. Wait, you’re not worried about his axe are you? I know you two have history but—-<br />

'''Bigby:''' I’m not worried.<br />

'''Toad:''' Right. Of course.<br />

Another crash is heard.<br />

'''[[Faith (Video Game)|Faith]]:''' Fuck you!<br />

Bigby stubs out his cigarette and heads upstairs.<br />

'''Toad:''' I didn’t know anybody else was up there.

{{!}}-{{!}}I’m heading up.=

Bigby throws away his cigarette and heads upstairs.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Fine. I’m heading up. Get your glamour.

{{!}}-{{!}}Why’s he so pissed?=

'''Bigby:''' So, what set him off?<br />

'''Toad:''' Who knows what it was this time. Man’s got a hair trigger. I avoid him as much as possible. <br />

'''Bigby:''' When did he start drinking?<br />

'''Toad:''' Not sure he ever stopped.<br />

Another crash is heard.<br />

'''Faith:''' Fuck you!<br />

Bigby stubs out his cigarette and heads upstairs.<br />

'''Toad:''' I didn’t know anybody else was up there.

|-|[Head Upstairs]=

Bigby throws away his cigarette.<br />

'''Bigby:''' I should probably go handle this.<br />

Bigby heads up the stairs.<br />

'''Toad:''' Yes, please. Thank you.

|-|What do you want me to do?=

'''Bigby:''' And what exactly do you want me to do?<br />

'''Toad:''' I want you to throw the fuckin’ Woodsman out of here. Drunk shit... He’s been going on like that for hours. Turn this place into dust if you let him. He’s in a fuckin’ rage.

Bigby ashes his cigarette onto the ground.<br />

'''Toad:''' Oh... Thanks for that, Bigby. You’re a real gentleman.<br />

The Woodsman yells and rubble falls from the ceiling.<br />

'''Toad:''' This is the last straw, Bigby. He has to go.

Toad mockingly waves at Bigby, then frowns.

'''Toad:''' Furry pricked gobshite... tell me how to spend my money... ''(spits)''

'''[[Toad Jr.|TJ]]:''' Dad? The lights are shaking again.

'''Toad:''' What’d I say? You want the Big Bad Wolf to take you away?

'''TJ:''' No.

'''Toad:''' Then get the fuck back inside.

Bigby reaches the hall outide the room with the commotion.

'''Conversation between the Woodsman and Faith'''

'''Woody:''' ...you’re gonna know who I fuckin’ am. You hear me? Hey! Look at me!

'''Faith:''' Just stop, okay? You’re drunk! Let go!

Woody and Bigby charge at each other and crash through the window. Bigby hits a lamppost, then lands on top of a car, crushing it and shattering the windows. He looks up to see Woody lying unconscious in the street nearby.

'''Bigby:''' Aw...shit.

Bigby collapses back on the car. Toad stands nearby with his hands on his hand in distress.

'''Bigby:''' Hey, Toad.

'''Toad:''' My...car...

'''Bigby:''' Yeah. Gimme a second.

'''Toad:''' Oh, no. By all means. Take your time. Make yourself comfortable. Can I get you anything? Pillow, perhaps.

<tabber>Sorry about the car.=

Woody approaches the car.

'''Toad:''' Well, at least you're not fucking dead.

Woody grabs Bigby's leg and drags him off the car, smashing him against a billboard and strangling him. Bigby grabs Woody's neck with one hand and gouges his eyes with the other.

'''Woody:''' Quit fucking around.

Woody bites Bigby's thumb, making him let go.

'''Woody:''' I know you're fucking in there. Come on out, you fucking dog.

Bigby starts to weaken and pass out.

'''Woody:''' I'll put you out of your misery. You fucking mongrel...you ignorant fuck...

Bigby closes his eyes.

'''Woody:''' Come on out, Wolf.

Bigby opens his eyes, which are now yellow, and snarls, revealing he now has fangs. Faith buries the axe in the back of the Woodsman's head, and he collapses. Bigby composes himself, his appearance returning to normal. Faith glances at Woody, who is slowly crawling along the ground. He collapses again, and she starts to search his pockets.

<tabber>What are you doing?=

'''Bigby:''' What are you doing?

'''Faith:''' Great.

Faith throws the coins on the ground and kicks Woody in the ribs.

'''Bigby:''' The guy's got an axe in his brain. He's not feeling that.

'''Faith:''' It's more for me. He'll be fine.

Faith steps on the axe, pressing it further into Woody's head.

'''Bigby:''' Guy's havin' a bad day.<br />

'''Faith:''' That makes two of us. I guess it's a good thing Fables are hard to kill.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Suppose it is.

|-|Stop her=

Bigby grabs Faith's wrist.<br />

'''Bigby:''' He's had enough.<br />

'''Faith:''' He's a Fable...son of a bitch can take plenty!

</tabber>

Faith walks over to the building steps and picks up her purse. Bigby pulls the axe out of Woody's head and tosses it on the ground. Faith puts a cigarette in her mouth and struggles to light it.

'''Faith:''' Shit...just...come on...

Faith continues trying to use the lighter, with no success.

<tabber>Light her cigarette...=

Bigby takes out his lighter and lights her cigarette.<br />

'''Faith:''' Thanks...

|-|[Give her the matchbook]=

Bigby hands the matchbook to Faith.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Beautiful...<br />

'''Faith:''' Thank you...<br />

''She'll remember that...''

'''Faith:''' What's the matter, Bigby? Tempted to take a bite? I guess those days are behind you.

</tabber>

'''Bigby:''' I feel like we've met before...

'''Faith:''' We probably have. We all sort of knew each other at one point or another...but things change, I guess.

'''Bigby:''' I guess.

Bigby walks back toward the street to see that Woody has disappeared.

'''Bigby:''' Shit...

Bigby starts to walk away, but Faith grabs his wrist.

'''Faith:''' Stop. We don't have to make any more of a thing out of it than it already is.

<tabber>This is about Fabletown.=

'''Bigby:''' It's not just about you. I can't have him running around the city in the state he's in.<br />

'''Faith:''' Good, 'cause I was just starting to worry it was all about me...<br />

'''Bigby:''' That's not what I mean.

|-|He hit you.=

'''Bigby:''' He hit you. He needs to pay for that.<br />

'''Faith:''' He's got nothin' to give, Sheriff. I checked. Besides, I just swung an axe into the guy's head...I'd say we're even.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Maybe I should be arresting you.<br />

'''Faith:''' I'm not gonna be doing this for much longer. So now's your chance.

|-|Are you sure?=

'''Bigby:''' Are you sure?<br />

'''Faith:''' Eh...he's had enough. For tonight, at least. Wouldn't be surprised if he has an axe to grind. That wasn't intentional...sorry.

|-|...=

'''Faith:''' I'm fine. Really. Don't worry about me.

</tabber>

Faith lets go of Bigby and turns away.

'''Bigby:''' How much was it he owed ya?

'''Faith:''' A hundred...

'''Bigby:''' And I'm guessing it'd be bad for you to show up empty-handed.

'''Faith:''' I'll be fine.

<tabber>[give her some money]=

'''Bigby:''' Let's see, I've got, uh...<br />

Bigby takes out some money and counts it.<br />

'''Bigby:''' It's twenty, forty...seven--eight. Fifty eight. It's all I got--it'll help, right? ''(offers money)'' Take it.<br />

'''Faith:''' It's okay. I'll be fine. You've done enough. Really.<br />

Faith takes the money.<br />

''You chose to give her money.''

'''Faith:''' It's okay. I'll be fine. You've done enough. Really.<br />

''You chose not to give her any money.''

'''Faith:''' You got me out of a bad situation back there...thanks.

'''Bigby:''' I'm still gonna need a statement.

'''Faith:''' I have to go drop off...what I have.

'''Bigby:''' Meet me back at my office, then.

'''Faith:''' It's a little late for an office visit, Sheriff. I'll swing by your apartment.

'''Bigby:''' How do you know where I...

'''Faith:''' You live in the smallest apartment in the Woodlands. Everyone knows that.

'''Bigby:''' Good to know.

'''Faith:''' You should get cleaned up. You look like shit. And I don't use that term lightly.

Faith touches the wounds on Bigby's face.

'''Faith:''' Some of these look pretty bad.

<tabber>That's harsh.=

'''Bigby:''' That's a little on the harsh side.<br />

'''Faith:''' I tell it like it is...when I can.

|-|I clean up okay.=

'''Bigby:''' I clean up okay.<br />

'''Faith:''' I'll believe it when I see it.

|-|Tell me what you really think.=

'''Bigby:''' Wow...tell me what you really think.

Faith turns Bigby's head to examine his wounds.<br />

'''Faith:''' That's gonna leave a mark. Or maybe not.

</tabber>

'''Faith:''' Hey... I need to tell you something.

'''Bigby:''' What is it?

Faith puts her hand on Bigby's shoulder and leans in to whisper.

'''Faith:''' You're not as bad as everyone says you are.

Faith kisses Bigby on the cheek, then walks away. She waves goodbye with two fingers.

'''Faith:''' I'll see you around...Wolf.

Faith disappears from view. Bigby looks out at the city, then puts a cigarette in his mouth and lights it.

==The Woodland Luxury Apartments==

''The Woodland Luxury Apartments''<br />''Fabletown''<br />''Late...''

Bigby is standing on the sidewalk outside of the Woodlands.

<tabber>Optional interaction: look at plaque=

The plaque says "The Woodland Luxury Apartments".<br />

'''Bigby:''' "Luxury Apartments". I wish they wouldn't advertise that...

Bigby enters the gate, and it closes behind him.

The sign says "STAY OFF THE GRASS!"<br />

'''Bigby:''' Snow can sometimes be a disciplinarian...

</tabber>

Bigby walks toward the entrance door, but stops when he hears rustling in the bushes. He sees [[Beauty (Video Game)|someone]] duck behind a tree.

<tabber>Don't make me come over there.=

'''Bigby:''' Don't make me come over there. Look, I've got an hour of paperwork ahead of me and I've already had to deal with one asshole tonight, so just--<br />

'''Beauty:''' Sorry, Bigby. Didn't mean to be an asshole.

|-|Come on out.=

'''Bigby:''' Come on out.<br />

'''Beauty:''' Alright...alright.

'''Bigby:''' There's no walking on the grass. Snow White's orders. She made a sign and everything.<br />

'''Beauty:''' I'll be sure to send her an apology.

'''Beauty:''' You're still standing there, aren't you?

</tabber>

Beauty steps out from behind the tree.

'''Bigby:''' Beauty...

Beauty starts to walk out of the bushes.

'''Beauty:''' Hello, Bigby.

Beauty walks across the grass and steps onto the path.

'''Beauty:''' I...wasn't expecting anyone. I know this looks a little odd, but there's an explanation. I swear.

<tabber>Out pretty late.=

'''Bigby:''' You're out pretty late...<br />

'''Beauty:''' Is there some sort of curfew I don't know about? What's with the third degree?

|-|Why did you hide?=

'''Bigby:''' Why'd ya hide when I walked up?<br />

'''Beauty:''' Well, I didn't know who it was. You can't be too careful these days.<br />

'''Bigby:''' No, you can't.

|-|Where are you going?=

'''Bigby:''' So...where you off to?<br />

'''Beauty:''' Well, I went for a walk. I don't see what's wrong with that...<br />

'''Bigby:''' Didn't say there was.<br />

'''Beauty:''' It's not a big deal. Just...you know...out. For a walk. That's all.

|-|...=

'''Beauty:''' Look, if you don't have anything to say, I'm just gonna...

</tabber>

Beauty checks her watch.

'''Beauty:''' Damn it. I'm late.

Beauty walks away, but pauses when she reaches the gate.

'''Beauty:''' Please, Bigby...promise me you won't tell Beast you saw me. He worries too much as it is, and... It would just make my life a lot easier. Just, please... Promise me.

<tabber>I promise.=

'''Bigby:''' Sure.<br />

'''Beauty:''' You promise?<br />

'''Bigby:''' I promise.<br />

'''Beauty:''' Thank you, Bigby.

|-|No. I can't do that.=

'''Bigby:''' No. I'm not lying for someone when I don't know the reason. Sorry.<br />

''You refused to lie.''<br />

'''Beauty:''' I don't have time to go into it right now.

|-|I'm staying out of it.=

'''Bigby:''' Look, whatever it is, it's between you and Beast. I'm staying out of it.<br />

''Beauty will remember that.''<br />

'''Beauty:''' I don't have time to go into it right now.

''You chose not to respond.''

</tabber>

'''Beauty:''' I'll explain it all to you later. I will, but I have to go.

Beauty opens the gate and steps outside.

<tabber>(Didn't promise to Beauty)=

'''Beauty:''' It's not what you...might be thinking.

|-|(Promised to Beauty)=

''Beauty appreciates your help.''<br />

'''Beauty:''' Thank you... for trusting me. Really. I appreciate it, Bigby.

Beauty walks away. Bigby enters the building. [[Grimble (Video Game)|The security guard]] is asleep at his desk.

Bigby pushes the elevator button. He steps inside the elevator when it arrives and pushes the button for his floor. Beast goes down the stairs and walks past the elevator, stopping when he sees Bigby.

Beast catches the closing elevator doors, and they reopen.

'''Beast:''' Have you seen my wife? Have you seen Beauty? So, have you?

Bigby sets down his keys and takes the phone off the receiver. He adjusts his tie uncomfortably.

Colin gets off the couch, and Bigby takes the seat. Colin lies down, leaning against a box on the floor. Bigby puts a cigarette in his mouth.

'''Colin:''' Got a smoke?

Bigby lights his cigarette, then gives Colin one and lights it as well.

'''Colin:''' Thanks. Couple thousand more of these, we'll be even on that house you owe me.

Bigby picks up a nearby bottle, but puts it down when he finds it empty.

'''Bigby:''' This has gotta stop. You can't keep sneaking off The Farm like this.

Bigby stands up and walks into the kitchen, followed by Colin. Bigby pours himself a glass of bourbon.

'''Colin:''' The fresh air and sunshine pitch they sell you on is bullshit. I didn't escape out of the Homelands to end up in some prison, okay? Don't send me back there, Bigby. You don't know what it's like, okay? You haven't been there.

Colin glances at the drink in Bigby's hand.

'''Colin:''' That for me?

'''Bigby:''' No.

Bigby walks over to his desk and examines a file.

'''Colin:''' The house didn't blow itself down, Bigby. That's all I'm sayin'. Do with that what you will. Now I'm not saying it's reason enough for me to have definitely been offered a drink, but, uh...it would have helped ease some of the pain you once caused me, yes? It also would have shown everyone how different you are now.

<tabber>I just want some rest.=

'''Bigby:''' If that was all you were saying, I'd be able to get some rest.

'''Colin:''' It probably also has something to do with how engaging you are in conversation.

Bigby and Colin walk into the dining room.

'''Colin:''' But, uh, no, hate's the wrong word. They fear you more than anything. You ate a lot of people back in your day.

'''Bigby:''' I thought we were all supposed to have a fresh start here. I can't change the past.

'''Colin:''' Well, you can't change people's memories, either. Look, I'm not saying it's fair...but it's real. People are scared of you. I mean, look at your hands.

Bigby glances at the bruises on his knuckles.

'''Colin:''' Who'd you get in a fight with? A Fable, right? I'm sure you're not going around punching Mundies.

'''Colin:''' Okay, sure. Silent treatment. I can do the same.<br />

''Colin will remember that.''

Bigby returns to the living room and sits down on the sofa.

'''Bigby:''' You think my job is easy? You try keeping a bunch of Fables from killing each other. How do you think this all works?

Colin lies down on the floor.

'''Colin:''' I don't know. How?

'''Bigby:''' By being big, and being bad.

'''Colin:''' "By being big, and being baaaad." Don't say that shit in front of people, it's embarrassing. That's the attitude that gets you in trouble. I'm sure you were shitty to everyone you came across tonight.

'''Bigby:''' Will you shut up?

'''Colin:''' Well, maybe if my throat wasn't so parched, I wouldn't have to keep talking.

'''Bigby:''' Wait, that doesn't make se--

'''Colin:''' Just gimme a drink. Please!

'''Bigby:''' Colin. ENOUGH already. I haven't slept in two days. I went out a second-story window. And I want to get in two seconds of shut-eye before I... Look. If I give you this, will you let me sleep?

'''Colin:''' Yeah, yeah, alright...probably.

<tabber>[Give Colin a Drink]=

Colin laps up the bourbon.

Bigby closes his eyes and leans back in the sofa, falling asleep. He wakes up a short time later when he hears knocking at the door. If he gave Colin a drink, he finds that Colin left sometime during his nap. Bigby stands up and walks over to the door. He adjusts his tie, then opens the door. He smiles, but his expression chances to surprise when he sees Snow instead of Faith.

'''Snow:''' Bigby!

'''Bigby:''' Snow?

Snow walks down the hallway, with Bigby alongside her.

'''Bigby:''' Snow. Snow!

Snow and Bigby stop when Cryer turns the corner.

'''Cryer:''' Hi.

'''Snow:''' Hello. Good morning. Or...evening.

'''Cryer:''' Ha. Yeah.

Snow and Bigby continue walking, reaching the elevator.

'''Snow:''' These walls are paper-thin...

Bigby pushes the elevator button.

'''Snow:''' We need to be careful. We'll talk outside.

The elevator arrives, and they step inside it. They exit after reaching the lobby. A security jacket can be seen on the steps outside the glass door. Bigby and Snow walk outside.

==The Woodlands Entrance==

Bigby lifts the jacket to reveal Faith's severed head.

'''Bigby:''' No...

'''Snow:''' You knew this girl? Is...she's not a Mundy...right? Who was she? I thought I knew everyone in Fabletown. She looks familiar. I can't place her, though.

'''Snow:''' No...you don't think he...?

'''Bigby:''' I don't think anything yet. Just gimme a second.

'''Snow:''' It's just...terrible. It took me a second to realize what I was even looking at.

<tabber>Who found her?=

'''Bigby:''' So... Who found her?<br />

'''Snow:''' I did. She was just like this. I didn't touch her. I grabbed Grimble's jacket to cover her with...then... I came to get you right away.<br />

'''Bigby:''' No one else was with you?<br />

'''Snow:''' No.

'''Bigby:''' So...tell me what happened. Every detail.<br />

'''Snow:''' All the more reason we shouldn't start a panic before we know what's going on.

Snow and Bigby see two people walking along the sidewalk across from the gate.

'''Snow:''' Have a look around. We don't have much time before people will be coming through here.

Bigby closes Faith's eyes. He examines her neck.

'''Bigby:''' Strange cut...what did this to her?

'''Snow:''' What could do something like that?

'''Bigby:''' Either something very sharp, or something with magic attached to it.

Bigby examines Faith's head.

'''Bigby:''' She was placed here with some care.

'''Snow:''' What do you mean?

'''Bigby:''' You can see that someone didn't just toss her here. She was deliberately placed...for us to find.

'''Snow:''' What kind of monster would do this?

Bigby examines Faith's mouth. He sees a piece of fabric between her teeth.

'''Bigby:''' What is...?

Bigby removes the fabric from her mouth and discovers that it's the ribbon she wore around her neck, tied to her ring.

'''Bigby:''' It's her ribbon. ''(looking at ring)'' There's some kind of symbol here.

'''Snow:''' Hm. I...I don't recognize it.

'''Bigby:''' Neither do I.

Bigby stands up and glances around the area. He sees a trail of blood on the ground.

'''Snow:''' Ugh, I...I'm sorry, this is just so surreal.

Bigby sighs in agreement.

'''Snow:''' Uh, what, uh, what do you want to do next?

<tabber>Investigate more=

'''Bigby:''' We still have some time...I should keep investigating the area.<br />

'''Snow:''' Okay. Good idea.<br />

'''Talk to Snow'''<br />

'''Bigby:''' Hey, Snow. You alright?<br />

'''Snow:''' Yes, thanks. But you should hurry. We don't have much time left. We should head back inside soon.

'''Snow:''' I'm going to have to tell Crane about this. As long as King Cole is gone, he's acting mayor...he needs to know. And he's going to find out anyway, so we may as well get out in front of it. It'll just be worse if he finds out we held it from him. I know you don't like him, but...he's our boss. This is part of the job.

<tabber>Don't tell him.=

'''Bigby:''' Don't tell him. It'll just complicated things. I've got all the motivation I need to find out who did this.<br />

''You asked her not to say anything.''<br />

'''Snow:''' He's the mayor--<br />

'''Bigby:''' Deputy mayor. The position's a joke.<br />

'''Snow:''' I'll think about it.<br />

'''Bigby:''' I just don't want him interfering.

'''Bigby:''' I guess it's useless to drag it out.<br />

''Snow appreciates your support.''<br />

'''Snow:''' That's how I feel too. I'm sure he won't be happy, but...it's just part of the process. Hopefully he can be rational about it.<br />

'''Bigby:''' I wouldn't hold my breath.<br />

'''Snow:''' I'm not.<br />

'''Bigby:''' I just don't want him interfering.

|-|Just wait a little...=

'''Bigby:''' We should wait until we have more to tell him. Right now, all we know is a girl is dead. Telling Crane doesn’t change that. I've got all the motivation I need to find out who did this. <br />

''You asked Snow to wait.''<br />

'''Snow:''' That sounds...reasonable but... I don’t know. I'll think about it.<br />

'''Bigby:''' I just don't want him interfering.

|-|...=

'''Snow:''' It's the right thing to do.<br />

''You left Snow unsure.''

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' Crane's not what's important right now. We need to figure out who this girl was, so we can find whoever did this. Take this back to Doctor Swineheart. He can take a look at it. I'll meet you at the Business Office.

Snow walks inside the building. Bigby covers Faith's head with the jacket.

==Business Office==

Bigby walks past a line of people outside the business office and up to the door.

'''Gren:''' What're you--blind? What? You don't see there's a line? I been standing here a half hour already.

Gren angrily walks up to Bigby.

'''Gren:''' You get to just walk in? Must be nice, being the sheriff... Do whatever the fuck you like.

<tabber>I don't have time for this.=

'''Bigby:''' I don't have time for this.<br />

'''Gren:''' Yeah, you and all the rest of 'em in there.<br />

''He will remember that.''

|-|I'm cutting the line.=

'''Bigby:''' I know. I'm taking cuts.<br />

''He will remember that.''<br />

'''Gren:''' Is that supposed to be funny? You see anyone here laughing, Sheriff?

|-|I work here.=

'''Bigby:''' I work here.<br />

'''Gren:''' And what great work you do, Sheriff.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Hmm...that didn't feel very genuine.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

Bigby enters the office.

'''Gren:''' Fucker...

Bigby approaches the middle of the room, where Crane and Snow are standing.

'''Crane:''' --and now you tell me there's a killer on the loose? ...you two tittering behind my back. --because you are the one bringing this to me, Miss Snow. The one who so simply "stumbled" upon this catastrophe on our very doorstep! The last thing I need with Mayor Cole away is a hysteria. Do you understand me?

'''Snow:''' Yes. Of course I do, but--

'''Crane:''' Don't interrupt me, Miss Snow!

'''Snow:''' You asked me a question!

'''Crane:''' Don't change the subject! You are to blame for this unpleasantness, Miss Snow!

'''Snow:''' I brought you this news as soon as I could!

'''Crane:''' You are trusted to keep things running smoothly around here! This is a disaster! Who else is to blame, if not you?

<tabber>It's my fault.=

'''Bigby:''' If anyone's to blame, it's me. You don't need to be yelling at her.<br />

''You took the blame.''<br />

'''Crane:''' Oh, your role in this is duly noted! Yes, let's talk about that!

|-|Back off!=

'''Bigby:''' Back off, Ichabod! It's not her fault.<br />

''You took Snow's side.''<br />

'''Snow:''' I don't need your help, Bigby.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Instead of trying to assign blame, maybe we should figure out how to catch the fucker who did this.<br />

'''Crane:''' Oh, says the man who is the most to blame for this catastrophe! How convenient.

|-|No one to blame.=

'''Bigby:''' It isn't anyone's fault. Instead of trying to assign blame, maybe we should figure out how to catch the fucker who did this.<br />

'''Crane:''' Oh? Is that how you see things?<br />

''The Deputy Mayor didn't appreciate that.''

|-|[stay out of it] / ...=

'''Crane:''' See? Even Bigby agrees with me...as incompetent as he is.<br />

''Snow took the blame.''

</tabber>

'''Crane:''' Sheriff, you are the one charged with protecting the citizens of Fabletown.

Crane sits down behind his desk.

'''Crane:''' Your failure to do so cost someone their life, and the safety of the entire community! Tell me you've been doing something. Are there any leads? Suspects?

Snow sits down in one of the chairs in front of the desk.

'''Crane:''' Anything? Anything at all? Any shred of evidence you two know what the hell you're doing? Because right now, I have half a mind to fire the both of you.

<tabber>Her pimp=

'''Bigby:''' Yeah. Her pimp.<br />

''You named the girl's pimp as your suspect.''<br />

'''Crane:''' Her...was she a...?<br />

'''Bigby:''' Yeah. She was worried about a money situation.<br />

'''Crane:''' Well, this is just wonderful. Not only was a Fable killed, but it was a Fable hooker to boot.

|-|The Woodsman=

'''Bigby:''' The Woodsman is a person of interest...from what we've been able to gather, he was last seen with the victim.<br />

''You named the Woodsman as a suspect.''<br />

'''Crane:''' The Woodsman? That drunk wretch was the cause of this?<br />

'''Bigby:''' It's a lead. Nothing's certain yet.<br />

'''Crane:''' Well, find him! Get him in here if that's all you have to go on.

|-|Could be Bluebeard.=

'''Bigby:''' Bluebeard was mentioned...<br />

''You implicated Bluebeard.''<br />

'''Crane:''' Don't be absurd! Bluebeard is out of the country as we speak, so don't even think about accusing him of such a treacherous affair!<br />

'''Bigby:''' The guy has a history of beheading young women. I’d say that’s something worth checking out.<br />

'''Crane:''' If all you're operating off of is ancient history, we're all in much more trouble than I imagined. By that rationale, you’re a suspect as well, Wolf.

|-|...=

'''Snow:''' Bluebeard came to mind. It's his M.O. It's shaky, but--<br />

''Snow put forth her own theory.''<br />

'''Crane:''' Don't be absurd! Bluebeard is out of the country as we speak, so don't even think about accusing him of such a treacherous affair! If all you're operating off of is ancient history, we're all in much more trouble than I imagined.

</tabber>

'''Crane:''' You two need to get a handle on this situation quickly, and quietly. The last thing we need is all of Fabletown knowing there's a killer amongst us. Snow.

'''Snow:''' Yes...sir?

'''Crane:''' Call Vivian right this minute and let her know I'm coming in early for my...massage.

'''Snow:''' I will.

'''Crane:''' Where is the bottle of wine you were to purchase? Oh, bother. Forget it. Can't do anything right.

Snow and Crane stand up, and the latter walks away.

'''Crane:''' Do your job, Sheriff...or we'll find someone who can.

<tabber>Fuck you.=

'''Bigby:''' You know what?<br />

'''Snow:''' Stop. We'll get on it right away, sir.

|-|You're an asshole.=

'''Bigby:''' You know what?<br />

'''Snow:''' Stop. We'll get on it right away, sir.

'''Bigby:''' You know what?<br />

'''Snow:''' Stop. We'll get on it right away, sir.

Bigby says nothing.

Crane leaves the office.

'''Snow:''' You would've just pissed him off more.

'''Bigby:''' Alright.

'''Snow:''' Well, that could've gone better.

<tabber>(Said to tell Crane)=

'''Snow:''' Well...maybe we should have "dragged it out".<br />

'''Bigby:''' For what it's worth...I still think it was better to tell him.<br />

'''Snow:''' Yeah. Maybe...

|-|(Said not to tell Crane)=

'''Bigby:''' I told you not to tell him.<br />

'''Snow:''' I know...I probably should've listened to you.

|-|(Said to wait)=

'''Snow:''' Well... I guess I should've listened to you and waited.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Wasn't gonna say I told you so.<br />

'''Snow:''' You don't have to say it. It would've been better to have more to offer. Get our ducks in a row.

</tabber>

Bigby puts a cigarette in his mouth.

'''Snow:''' Oh--Crane doesn't like people smoking in--never mind. Smoke away.

Bigby lights his cigarette.

<tabber>Crane is an asshole.=

'''Bigby:''' What an asshole.<br />

'''Snow:''' Yup. That was about an 8 on the asshole scale. Asshole scale...that doesn't sound right.

|-|He gets a morning massage?=

'''Bigby:''' Who gets a massage this early?<br />

'''Snow:''' Crane. It doesn't really matter the time of day. The mere scent of stress and he's out the door.

|-|What's the wine about?=

'''Bigby:''' Wine to a massage?<br />

'''Snow:''' Probably a gift. The weird part of that is that he's actually being nice to someone. I know I bought that damn bottle.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

Bufkin peeks out from behind the top of a cabinet.

'''Bufkin:''' Is...is he gone?

'''Snow:''' Yes. Thankfully.

Bigby flies through the air, carrying the bottle of wine. He lands on the desk and tries to open the bottle with his teeth.

'''Snow:''' Bufkin!

Bufkin sets down the bottle and smiles sheepishly.

'''Bufkin:''' Hello, Miss Snow.

'''Snow:''' Drinking this early? Where did you get that?

'''Bufkin:''' It was by Mr. Ichabod's desk.

'''Snow:''' Then don't you think it probably belongs to him?

'''Bufkin:''' Maybe.

Snow picks up the bottle and walks away.

'''Bufkin:''' How are you today, Mr. Bigby?

<tabber>I'm fine.=

'''Bigby:''' Fine, Bufkin. Thanks for asking.<br />

Bufkin smiles.

|-|I'm not great.=

'''Bigby:''' It hasn't been a great morning, Bufkin.<br />

'''Bufkin:''' Sorry...<br />

'''Bigby:''' Not your fault. Thanks for asking, though.

|-|Fuck off.=

'''Bigby:''' Fuck off, Bufkin.<br />

Bufkin looks saddened.

|-|...=

'''Bufkin:''' Sorry...

</tabber>

''Bufkin will remember that.''

'''Snow:''' Bufkin...get the books.

'''Bufkin:''' Which books?

'''Snow:''' The ones with all the Fables in it!

'''Bigby:''' I'm not sure that was any more specific.

'''Snow:''' Bring the first three.

'''Bufkin:''' Be back in a few minutes.

Bufkin flies away.

'''Snow:''' He knows the ones I'm talking about. There's bound to be information on her here...somewhere. We'll at least be able to get her real name from the books whenever Bufkin finds them. In the meantime, poke around. Maybe the mirror can help.

Snow picks up the phone.

'''Snow:''' I really have to get this appointment squared away, but...let me know if you need anything.

'''Snow's Comments on the Phone'''

'''Snow:''' Hello, Vivian? Hi, this is Snow White, Mr. Crane's assistant? Hi, yes, I'm just calling to let you know that Mr. Crane's schedule seems to have filled up for the rest of the day and he's coming in early for his appointment.

'''Snow:''' Yes, that's right. Mm-hmm. No, we got your invoice. Yes. It should be squared away. Yup. No, I can wait.

'''Snow:''' Yes, I mean, I questioned it only due to the amount. It seemed a bit excessive. Mm-hmm. I have the record right here, give me one moment.

'''Snow:''' Well, that's not what I have here. I can look through it again and get back to you. Mm-hmm.

'''Snow:''' I'll be sure to let him know. Yes. That's not a problem. Okay. Thank you.

'''Bufkin:''' "Donkeyskin girl, also known as Donkeyskin, also known as ''(laughs)'' Ass' skin, prefers to go by the name Faith." Poetic!

'''Snow:''' Bufkin. We don't need the commentary.

'''Bufkin:''' The story of Donkeyskin. "There was once a great king with a beautiful queen. The queen grew ill and had her husband promise to only marry the most beautiful girl in the kingdom. After a long search, it became clear that the only woman in the land that could match her beauty was...his daughter...Faith."

Bufkin pauses as the group shares looks of horror.

'''Bufkin:''' "She had a magic cloak made from the skin of her father's prized donkey...that would hide her beauty, so she could escape his kingdom. Eventually she married a prince, who could see past the magic cloak and knew her true beauty...and they lived happily ever after." Should I...mark it, Miss Snow?

'''Snow:''' Yes. Please.

Bufkin puts a "DECEASED" stamp onto Faith's file.

'''Snow:''' What's her husband's name?

'''Bufkin:''' Lawrence... Prince Lawrence.

'''Snow:''' We got what we came for.

'''Bigby:''' Yeah.

'''Snow:''' Her name's Faith, she was married to Prince Lawrence. I mean, that's more than we--

'''Bigby:''' Her name WAS Faith.

'''Snow:''' Yeah.

'''Bigby:''' We should talk to the husband.

'''Snow:''' You think he did it?

<tabber>He's our first suspect=

'''Bigby:''' With this sort of thing, it's usually the person who knew them best.<br />

'''Snow:''' Or it's someone completely random.

|-|We have to notify him.=

'''Bigby:''' No. I don't, but we need to let him know about his wife.

|-|Can't rule him out.=

'''Bigby:''' Nothing would surprise me, at this point. We can't rule him out.

|-|...=

'''Snow:''' Well...I know what it's like to have a falling out with a prince... I don't trust any of them at this point.

</tabber>

Bigby returns to the Mirror.

'''Bigby:''' Mirror, mirror, blah blah able, blah blah blah about this Fable.

'''Mirror:''' Of which Fable do you wish to know?

<tabber>Faith's Father=

'''Bigby:''' Show me...Faith's father. The old king.<br />

The mirror shows a skeletal hand with a signet ring on it and an arrow near the corpse.<br />

'''Bigby:''' I guess that crosses him off the suspect list...

|-|Faith=

'''Bigby:''' Show me... Show me Faith.<br />

'''Mirror:''' Through powerful magics her whereabouts concealed. Unfortunately for you, "These lips are sealed."<br />

'''Bigby:''' What?<br />

'''Mirror:''' These lips are sealed. It's not my choice of phrasing, Bigby. It's simply the way this has to be.

|-|Prince Lawrence=

'''Bigby:''' He's a prince, I think. Show me Prince Lawrence.<br />

The Mirror shows Lawrence slumped over in a chair, a bloody dagger at his feet.<br />

'''Bigby:''' What's he been doing? Where is this?<br />

'''Snow:''' Where's what?<br />

'''Bigby:''' Do you know where Prince Lawrence lives?<br />

'''Snow:''' If he's a prince...probably relocated in the South Bronx. Yellow building, red window shutters?<br />

'''Bigby:''' Red frames.<br />

'''Snow:''' Yeah, that's the one. I can take us there.

|-|Exit=

'''Bigby:''' Nobody, right now.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' Anything we can use?

'''Bigby:''' Yeah. That'll have to do for now.

'''Snow:''' Come on. We're going over there.

As Bigby and Snow approach the door, the phone rings.

'''Snow:''' Sorry, I have to get that.

Snow picks up the phone.

'''Snow:''' Hello? Woodlands Business Off--yes. I--he is. Hold on. Bigby...it's for you.

Snow hands the phone to Bigby.

'''Toad:''' Bigby! It's me. Toad. You there?

<tabber>Glamour=

'''Bigby:''' Toad. Got your glamour yet?<br />

'''Toad:''' Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine.

|-|The car=

'''Bigby:''' Sorry about the car.<br />

'''Toad:''' Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine.

|-|What do you want?=

'''Bigby:''' What do you want?

|-|...=

'''Toad:''' Are you there, man?

</tabber>

'''Toad:''' Bigby! Shit. Listen, right? There's a bloke upstairs, going through all the Woodsman's things. Get over here, Bigby! Before he--wait. Hang on. Oy! Shit. Hey!

The phone cuts out, and Bigby sets it down.

'''Snow:''' What was that about?

'''Bigby:''' Hard to say. Something going on over at Toad's place.

'''Snow:''' What about Faith's husband?

'''Bigby:''' I don't know. I couldn't really tell, but...he could be in trouble. And we should go there anyway to search her apartment. Toad might have to wait.

'''Snow:''' Whenever you're ready.

Bigby opens the door, and he and Snow walk outside, all the way to the outside of the building.

'''Snow:''' Did Toad say who was there? Was it the Woodsman?

'''Bigby:''' I don't know. It's possible. Whoever it was, it didn't seem like Toad was happy to see 'em.

'''Snow:''' Well, maybe Prince Lawrence can wait.

'''Bigby:''' You didn't see him. He...could use some help too.

'''Snow:''' Well...where to first?

Bigby steps outside the gate.

'''Toad:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' Bigby! Shit. Listen, right? There's a bloke upstairs, going through all the Woodsman's things.

'''Snow:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' You think he did it? What's her husband's name?

'''Bufkin:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' Lawrence... Prince Lawrence.

<tabber>TOAD'S APARTMENT=

'''Bigby:''' Toad sounds like he needs help right now. We can check in on Prince Lawrence after.<br />

'''Snow:''' Okay. I'm not looking forward to breaking the news to him anyway.

|-|LAWRENCE'S APARTMENT=

'''Bigby:''' We need to tell him about his wife. He deserves to know.<br />

'''Snow:''' You're right. And Toad's a tough...toad. He can probably handle himself for a few hours.<br />

'''Bigby:''' He'll have to.

</tabber>

==The Woodsman's Apartment==

''The Woodsman's Apartment''<br />''South Bronx''<br />''Early Morning''

Bigby and Snow walk toward the apartments.

'''Bigby:''' And we ended up going out the window and I landed on Toad's car.

'''Snow:''' You guys made a real mess.

'''Bigby:''' Yeah...it looks worse in the day.

Bigby runs into the building and enters the Woodsman's apartment, finding it empty.<br />

Bigby walks up to the hole in the wall, and Snow looks up at him expectantly. Bigby shakes his head. Snow walks into the building.<br />

'''Toad:''' Bigby! And Miss White! Surely you didn't come all this way just for my bother! Sorry, Bigby. It's embarrassing to have to admit, but, eh, I thought there was someone else in Woody's place. There wasn't, though, not when I checked--nothin' but a leaky drain pipe. Imagination must have got the best of me. So, ya know, false alarm. Sorry for dragging Miss White into this--but thanks for coming, much appreciated.

Dee runs through a door at the end of the alley, followed by Bigby. Dee throws a table down the stairs, which either hits Bigby or is successfully dodged by him. They run up another staircase, and Dee throws down a vase and then another table, which can again hit or miss Bigby depending on his reactions. Dee and Bigby run through a hallway, the former toppling a couch into the latter's path. Bigby lifts the couch and crawls under it, continuing the chase. He reaches two doors; the left has a broken "3B" sign, and the right door is ajar.

Someone opens a door as Bigby is running, which he either dodges or crashes into. Bigby sees Dee fall past a window, and he crashes through it, landing in the same dumpster as Dee.

'''Snow:''' Right, we've had it worse, but...not by much. Maybe this isn't for me. I thought public service was...pure. A way to help.

<tabber>Stick with it.=

'''Bigby:''' You should stick it out. There are Fables that would give up a lot to be in the position you're in, and I think it's easier to change something from the inside.<br />

'''Snow:''' Not the advice I imagined hearing from you.<br />

'''Bigby:''' I'm full of surprises.

'''Bigby:''' You should get out of there. If it's as bad as you say it is, maybe there are better ways to get things done outside of the system.<br />

'''Snow:''' It's something I have to consider. Never took you for a quitter.<br />

'''Bigby:''' We're not talking about me.

Bigby walks back to the cab and leans down next to the open window.

'''Holly:''' What do ya want, Sheriff?

<tabber>Woodsman.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm looking for the Woodsman.<br />

''You told her the truth.''<br />

''You stayed silent.''

'''Bigby:''' Look, I'm not even gonna ask where he is now, okay? I just wanna know that last time he was here. That's all.

Holly looks over at Gren.

'''Holly:''' Who?

'''Bigby:''' I'm being nice, so try again.

'''Holly:''' He hasn't been here for a few weeks.

Gren shakes his head.

'''Holly:''' No...maybe. I don't know. But, yeah, he hasn't been here in a while, if he's been here at all...which...I...I don't know.

<tabber>Does he tell you when to close, too?=

'''Bigby:''' Does he tell you when to close too?<br />

'''Holly:''' Nope, and he doesn't tell me when to tell you to fuck off.

|-|You're your own woman.=

'''Bigby:''' Don't let him tell you what to do. You're your own woman.<br />

'''Holly:''' Well, this is me talkin', Bigby... Fuck off.

<tabber>Don't lie to me.=

'''Bigby:''' Don't lie to me. It'd be bad for everybody.<br />

'''Gren:''' Call me a liar, and it'll be bad for you.

|-|Would a drink help you remember?=

'''Bigby:''' How about I buy you a drink?<br />

'''Gren:''' How about you keep your drink and piss off?

|-|Tell me what you know.=

'''Bigby:''' Come on. Tell me what you know.<br />

'''Dee:''' Fuck, man! That's not necessary.<br />

Woody manages to escape.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Shit...<br />

'''Dee:''' He's the one you want. Not me.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Your brother won't be saving you this time. C'mon. You're under arrest.<br />

'''Dee:''' I told you. I didn't do it.

|-|Go after Woody=

Bigby slams Woody against the wall and twists his arm behind his back, handcuffing him.<br />

'''Woody:''' Aaargh! You said you wouldn't hurt me!<br />

'''Bigby:''' You said you wouldn't run.<br />

Dee manages to escape.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Shit...<br />

'''Woody:''' Guy's covered in blood and you let him go?<br />

'''Bigby:''' No one asked you.<br />

'''Woody:''' Aaargh!<br />

'''Bigby:''' C'mon. You're under arrest.<br />

'''Woody:''' I didn't do it.

</tabber>

'''Bigby:''' Then you got nothing to worry about.

Bigby and Dee/Woody leave the Trip Trap.

==Street==

Bigby and Dee/Woody walk along the street near the Woodlands. Bigby sees police cars gathered outside the building, so he handcuffs Dee/Woody to the nearby streetlight.

'''Bigby:''' Do anything stupid and I'll throw you down the Witching Well myself.

<tabber>(Went after Woody)=

'''Woody:''' Alright.

</tabber>

Beast runs up to the police tape, but is stopped by an officer. Bigby ducks under the tape and starts to walk toward the building. He sees a horrified policeman leaving the scene. A couple officers see Bigby approaching the Woodlands and run toward him in a panic. Bigby stops near the front steps, where a crowd of officers are gathered. He sees Snow's decapitated head lying in a pool of blood.

==Upper West Side Precinct==

''Upper West Side Precinct''<br />''The Following Afternoon''

Sheriff [[Bigby Wolf (Video Game)|Bigby Wolf]] has flashbacks of being at the Woodlands the previous night.

'''Kelsey:''' Mr. Wolf!

Bigby snaps back to the present, where he is sitting in an interrogation room with a picture of Snow's head on the table in front of him. Detective [[Kelsey Brannigan]] moves the picture to the middle of the table.

'''Kelsey:''' You're making this more difficult than it has to be. If you'd just cooperate and answer the questions, you can go home. Maybe get some sleep.

Bigby puts a cigarette in his mouth and lights it.

'''Kelsey:''' How are you feeling? I know it's been a long night for you. You look like you could use some rest.

<tabber>Hunky dory.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm hunky dory. Thanks for asking!<br />

'''Kelsey:''' There's no need to get aggressive. I'm trying to help you.

|-|I need to find the killer.=

'''Bigby:''' I'll be better when I find who did this...which I can't do while sitting in here.<br />

'''Kelsey:''' We all want the same thing here, Bigby.

|-|I'm pissed off.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm feeling pretty fucking pissed off right now, if I'm honest. I'd like to smash everything in this room.<br />

'''Kelsey:''' Is that a threat?<br />

'''Bigby:''' Depends on how much you like the furniture.<br />

'''Kelsey:''' I didn't think that was funny...in case you were waiting for me to laugh.

|-|[Don't answer] / ...=

'''Kelsey:''' ''(disapprovingly)'' Nice.

</tabber>

'''Kelsey:''' Look... I know what you must be going through... Really, I do...but I could use your cooperation.

<tabber>You don't know who did it.=

'''Bigby:''' You don't know anything. If you did, you wouldn't be sitting here, talking to me. You'd be talking to the piece of shit that did this.<br />

'''Kelsey:''' Well, you stonewalling me like this isn't helping either of us, so why don't you cut the shit and...<br />

Kelsey stands up and slams her hands on the table, then composes herself and sits back down.<br />

'''Kelsey:''' I'm trying to help you, Bigby.

|-|I don't think you do.=

'''Bigby:''' Ya know, I hate to say it, but I don't think you do.<br />

'''Kelsey:''' Of course...you're...you're right. I can't imagine what you're going through right now.

|-|Fuck off.=

'''Bigby:''' Well, I'd appreciate if you'd fuck off.<br />

'''Kelsey:''' Bigby...I've been interviewing people all night.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Then it's probably not the first time you've heard it today. Maybe you should take a hint...you're a detective, right?<br />

'''Kelsey:''' Well, you stonewalling me like this isn't helping either of us, so why don't you cut the shit and...<br />

Kelsey stands up and slams her hands on the table, then composes herself and sits back down.<br />

'''Kelsey:''' I'm trying to help you, Bigby.

|-|[Smoke] / ...=

'''Kelsey:''' ''(disapprovingly)'' That's very helpful. Thank you.

</tabber>

Kelsey glances toward the one-way mirror, where two officers are observing their conversation from behind the glass.

<tabber>(Didn't stay silent)=

'''Bigby:''' What is it with you cops always trying to empathize with people? "I know this must be hard for you." Do you? Do you fucking know? Have you had a friend killed and their head left at your fucking doorstep? No? Didn't think so.<br />

Bigby looks away, then back at Kelsey.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Your nose is bleeding.

</tabber>

Kelsey suddenly looks disoriented, and her nose starts bleeding. She wipes away some of the blood.

<tabber>Are you okay?=

'''Bigby:''' Are you...okay? You don't look so good. Detective Brannigan?<br />

'''Kelsey:''' I'm Detective Brannigan.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Uh, yeah. I know... I just said that. Is there something--

|-|You missed a spot.=

'''Bigby:''' You missed a spot. You... You just smeared it... across your face. You got a tissue or something?<br />

'''Kelsey:''' I'm Detective Brannigan.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Uh, yeah. I know... I just said that. Is there something--

|-|You look nuts.=

'''Bigby:''' You look nuts right now. You realize that, right? It's kinda hard to take this seriously with that all over your face. It's weird. Detective Brannigan?<br />

'''Kelsey:''' I'm Detective Brannigan.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Uh, yeah. I know... I just said that. Is there something--

|-|...=

'''Kelsey:''' I'm Detective Brannigan.

</tabber>

'''Kelsey:''' Do you hear that?

Kelsey puts her hand over her ear.

'''Kelsey:''' Please...please...

Kelsey gasps in pain. Thudding noises are heard behind the glass as the officers pass out.

'''Kelsey:''' I'm sorry, just...make it stop...please.

Kelsey passes out on the table. A moment later, [[Ichabod Crane (Video Game)|Ichabod Crane]] enters the room, carrying a box labeled "EVIDENCE".

'''Crane:''' We have to go. Now!

<tabber>What did you do to her?=

'''Bigby:''' What did you do to her?<br />

'''Crane:''' She'll be fine!

|-|What's going on?=

'''Bigby:''' What the fuck is going on?<br />

'''Crane:''' You should be thanking me!

|-|Why are you here?=

'''Bigby:''' What are you doing here?<br />

'''Crane:''' You should be thanking me!

|-|...=

'''Crane:''' She'll be fine!

</tabber>

'''Crane:''' It's just a memory wipe spell. Very expensive, but it works. The whole station will forget the last 24 hours and everything they saw at the Woodlands. Well, hurry up!

Bigby extinguishes his cigarette in the ashtray. Crane walks out the door. Bigby starts to follow him, but turns back to take the photo of Snow.

==Car==

Crane and Bigby are driving in a car. They both clear their throats awkwardly.

<tabber>Thanks for the ride.=

'''Bigby:''' Thanks for the ride.<br />

''Crane noticed that.''<br />

'''Crane:''' Certainly.

|-|Thanks for the bailout.=

'''Bigby:''' Thanks for bailing me out.<br />

''Crane noticed that.''<br />

'''Crane:''' Certainly.

|-|This doesn't change anything.=

'''Bigby:''' This doesn't change anything.<br />

''Crane will remember that.''<br />

'''Crane:''' Fine.

|-|[Ignore him] / ...=

''Crane noticed your silence.''

</tabber>
<tabber>(Went after Dee)=

'''Crane:''' We, uh, we found Tweedle Dee chained up to a post.

|-|(Went after Woody)=

'''Crane:''' We, uh, found the Woodsman chained up to a post last night.

</tabber>

'''Crane:''' That was your doing, correct?

'''Bigby:''' Yeah.

<tabber>(Went after Dee)=

'''Crane:''' Well, I don't know why you detained him. Dee was at the Trip Trap when Snow was left at the Woodlands, so he couldn't possibly be involved in this mayhem. Bluebeard's currently interrogating him...and he hasn't said anything useful. And, Bigby, we have to tread carefully here. We can't implicate an innocent man, and people are already worried about your conduct. As of late.

{{#tag:tabber|He has a brother.=

'''Bigby:''' There's two of them. Dee and Dum. And they've been snooping around every crime scene I've looked at.<br />

'''Crane:''' That doesn't mean they're necessarily involved in the murders.

{{!}}-{{!}}He's working for somebody.=

'''Bigby:''' He's working for somebody, and whoever it is wants him snooping around at every crime scene I've looked at.<br />

'''Crane:''' That doesn't necessarily mean they're involved in the murders.

{{!}}-{{!}}Not now, Crane.=

'''Bigby:''' I'll see what's what when we get back home, but for now...let's just shut up for a while, alright?<br />

'''Crane:''' We have to formulate a plan of action, Bigby.<br />

'''Bigby:''' I will. Just not right now.

{{!}}-{{!}}[Ignore him] / ...=

Bigby says nothing.

}}

|-|(Went after Woody)=

'''Crane:''' Well, thanks to you, there's been at least some hope in this whole dreadful affair. I'm confident he has some information about the slayings. Bluebeard's currently interrogating him...and he's already to the point of confession. He was involved, definitely, that much we can tell from his babbling. He just must have had some sort of accomplice.

{{#tag:tabber|He's not a strong suspect.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm actually not so sure about that.<br />

'''Crane:''' You don't think he's involved?<br />

'''Bigby:''' He was with me whenever the... whenever she was left at the stairs.<br />

'''Crane:''' Yes, but all that means is he didn't do it alone.

{{!}}-{{!}}I've got questions for him.=

'''Bigby:''' Yeah... Good. I've got questions for him.<br />

'''Crane:''' Well...we all do.

{{!}}-{{!}}Not now, Crane.=

'''Bigby:''' I'll see what's what when we get back home, but for now...let's just shut up for a while, alright?<br />

'''Crane:''' We have to formulate a plan of action, Bigby.<br />

'''Bigby:''' I will. Just not right now.

{{!}}-{{!}}[Ignore him] / ...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

They stop at a red light. A bus drives past them, a lottery ad on the side saying "Will you be next?"

'''Crane:''' I know what you're thinking, Bigby. It's been one full night and a slice of morning, and I already miss her too.

The light turns green, and they keep driving.

'''Crane:''' You know, I never get more homesick than when one of us dies. And now...for it to be Snow...I've never been good with these sorts of things. I just can't believe this is really happening.

<tabber>It's hard.=

'''Bigby:''' Yeah...it's hard.<br />

''Crane will remember that.''<br />

'''Crane:''' Our stories used to be so simple. We had a beginning, a middle, and an end. But ever since we moved to this awful city...everything's gotten so confused. Did she, um, give any indication to what she was thinking...when you saw her last, I mean?

|-|You don't really care.=

'''Bigby:''' Give me a fucking break.<br />

'''Crane:''' What?<br />

'''Bigby:''' You treated her like the fucking maid, and now you want a shoulder to cry on? You didn't care then, and you don't care now.<br />

''Crane will remember that.''<br />

'''Crane:''' That is not true! Not true at all! I thought we had some common ground...could discuss this like gentlemen!

{{#tag:tabber|We have no common ground.=

'''Bigby:''' Let's get something straight here, alright? We have exactly nothing in common. Everything that connects us is dead and gone.

{{!}}-{{!}}Fine.=

'''Bigby:''' Alright. It's been a shitty couple of days. I know you're trying.<br />

'''Crane:''' Thank you.

{{!}}-{{!}}Just forget it.=

'''Bigby:''' Just forget it.

{{!}}-{{!}}...=

Bigby says nothing.

'''Crane:''' I don't know why I'm asking you, but did she give any indication as to what she was thinking...when you saw her last, I mean?

|-|I said not now.=

(If Bigby said not now.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' When I said I didn't want to talk right now, I meant it. Not about the case, and definitely not about this.<br />

''Crane will remember that.''<br />

'''Crane:''' Well, I apologize if my attempt at handling this has "disturbed" you, Bigby, but I thought we had some common ground.

{{#tag:tabber|We have no common ground.=

'''Bigby:''' Dwelling on this shit isn't helping.<br />

''You ignored Crane.''<br />

'''Crane:''' Our stories used to be so simple. We had a beginning, a middle, and an end. But ever since we moved to this awful city...everything's gotten so confused. Did she, um, give any indication to what she was thinking...when you saw her last, I mean?

</tabber>

'''Crane:''' I don't know why, but I'd like to know that she was...I guess, fine, I suppose.

<tabber>She was frustrated with you.=

'''Bigby:''' Yeah, she gave an "indication" she was pissed at you by saying that she was pissed at you.<br />

'''Crane:''' At me?<br />

'''Bigby:''' She was frustrated with the whole fucking system and tried of having to turn Fables away. It wore her down.

|-|She wanted to change things.=

'''Bigby:''' She could come off as...callous, sometimes, but she wasn't really. She said that she wanted to change things...make it easier for Fables to get help when they need it.

|-|She told me to be careful.=

'''Bigby:''' She just told me to be careful.<br />

'''Crane:''' She was always fond of you, Bigby.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Yeah.

|-|...=

'''Crane:''' I just want to make sure that she wasn't going looking for trouble, that's all.

</tabber>

'''Crane:''' I don't know what else to say, Bigby. we have to--have to put an end to this.

The car parks in front of the Woodlands.

'''Crane:''' It's been two murders in as many days. If we don't unearth our culprit and soon, there will likely be another on our doorstep tonight.

'''Bigby:''' I'll get it done.

'''Crane:''' Please, Bigby. For Miss White.

Bigby and Crane get out of the car.

'''Bigby:''' I got it!

Bigby slams the car door shut, cracking the window.

==The Woodland Luxury Apartments==

''The Woodland Luxury Apartments''<br />''Basement''<br />''Afternoon''

Bigby and Crane enter the Woodlands and walk toward the basement. [[Bluebeard (Video Game)|Bluebeard]] is already inside, along with Dee/Woody, who is strapped to a chair. Bluebeard is cleaning his knife with a rag.

<tabber>(Went after Dee)=

'''Bluebeard:''' That's not a very good answer, is it? Come on, just tell me what I want to know. It will make things a lot less painful for you...in theory.<br />

'''Dee:''' Oh! Were you planning on using that? I just thought you really liked rubbing your little sword.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' You ignorant fuck!<br />

Bluebeard puts his knife to Dee's throat.

|-|(Went after Woody)=

'''Woody:''' ''(singing)'' As I came down the Bowery...one evening in July... I met a maid who asked my trade, and a sailor John, said I...

Crane and Bigby enter the basement.

'''Crane:''' What the hell do you think you're doing?<br />

'''Blubeard:''' Hello, Ichabod. Sheriff.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Bluebeard.<br />

Bluebeard steps away from Dee.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' I was just chatting with our new friend.<br />

'''Crane:''' You were supposed to wait for us to get back! I told you, if you want to be involved, you will do things my way. No violence.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' Whatever you say, Ichabod.<br />

Bigby walks up to Dee.<br />

'''Dee:''' Hello, Bigby.<br />

'''Bigby:''' I want answers, Dee.<br />

'''Dee:''' Oh, goodie! I thought you wanted questions, and I was having so much trouble thinking of any good ones. Though I'd settled on, "How's your head?"<br />

'''Blubeard:''' You see what I've been dealing with? What are you going to do about this, Bigby?<br />

'''Crane:''' Shh!

{{#tag:tabber|This isn't a joke.=

'''Bigby:''' Do you think this is a joke? Snow White is dead.

{{!}}-{{!}}You're funny.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm glad you have a sense of humor. I hope that means you're willing to cooperate. Snow White is dead.

'''Dee:''' Look, I didn't kill anyone.

'''Bigby:''' And I'm supposed to just believe you?

'''Dee:''' You were with me when it happened, dummy.

'''Bigby:''' I still have questions for you, Dee.

'''Dee:''' Sounds like a personal problem.

'''Bluebeard:''' This is ridiculous.

'''Crane:''' Let him work. He's got more experience with these kinds of things.

{{#tag:tabber|Who's your boss?=

'''Crane:''' It's just...well, it's just common sense.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' Right.<br />

'''Crane:''' He's being...he's being too rough with him.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' If you don't have the stomach for it, you can always wait outside.<br />

'''Crane:''' He should just be asking him questions.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' This is how these sessions have to be conducted.<br />

'''Crane:''' He's just going too far with this.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' Sometimes you have to play the bad cop. You know that.

'''Bluebeard:''' Can we move this along? If you need some assistance, I'd be more than happy to provide some.

TJ cries and whimpers. Toad pats him on the back.

'''TJ:''' I know I'm supposed to, but I was scared, and I went to the top again. I couldn't help it.

==Witching Well Chamber==

''Witching Well Chamber''<br />''The Woodland Building''

Bigby, Snow, and Bufkin move through the chamber. Bufkin sets down the evidence box next to the pedestal containing the head and body of the glamoured corpse.

<tabber>Optional interaction: look at Witching Well=

Bigby looks down the well.

</tabber>

Bigby walks up to Snow and Bufkin. They look uncomfortably at the corpse.

'''Snow:''' Wow. I didn't realize... I've never seen her face before now.

<tabber>Are you okay?=

'''Bigby:''' Are you gonna be okay? You don't have to stay.<br />

'''Snow:''' I want to stay. I'll be fine, it's just...a little strange.

|-|This is weird.=

'''Bigby:''' This is weird.<br />

'''Snow:''' Yeah.

|-|It's just a body.=

'''Bigby:''' It's just a body, Snow. If you can't do this--<br />

'''Snow:''' No. I'll be fine. I want to be here.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' The glamour is so effective, its...invasive. But... Just do what you need to do.

Bigby examines the corpse's head.

<tabber>(Examined neck marks)=

'''Snow:''' If her neck wound was the same, there might be a ribbon in her mouth too.

|-|(Didn't examine neck marks)=

'''Snow:''' Check her mouth. There might be a ribbon in there...like before.

</tabber>

Bigby moves her jaw, making her mouth open.

'''Snow:''' Anything?

'''Bigby:''' Nothing.

<tabber>(Examined neck marks)=

'''Bigby:''' So it's not exactly the same.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' Can you...close her mouth?

Bigby does as Snow asked.

'''Snow:''' Thanks.

Bigby examines the corpse's brooch. He picks it up and hands it to Snow.

'''Snow:''' That's weird. I don't wear a brooch like that.

<tabber>(Examined neck marks)=

'''Snow:''' Why bother with the right perfume if the appearance isn't completely accurate?

</tabber>

'''Bigby:''' Maybe it really belonged to her...not part of the glamour.

'''Snow:''' Looks like something from the Homelands. Bufkin, do you recognize these symbols?

'''Bufkin:''' No, nothing I've seen before.

Bigby examines the corpse's neck mark.

'''Bigby:''' It looks just like Faith's did.

'''Snow:''' But there was nothing in her mouth this time. Do you think this was done by the same person?

'''Bigby:''' Hard to tell. Did Doctor Swineheart ever get back to you about Faith?

'''Snow:''' No. He said he wanted to run more tests.

Bigby examines the neck mark again.

'''Bigby:''' She got your perfume right.

'''Snow:''' How would she know...how do YOU know what perfume I wear?

'''Bigby:''' You can't fool this nose.

<tabber>(Examined perfume bottle)=

'''Bigby:''' Also, I saw the bottle on your desk.

</tabber>

Bigby examines the neck mark again.

'''Snow:''' Do you see that?

'''Bigby:''' Could be a bruise...

Bigby examines the rope marks on the corpse's ankles.

'''Bigby:''' Rope marks.

'''Bufkin:''' She was tied up?

<tabber>(Talked to Toad and TJ)=

'''Bigby:''' They tied cinderblocks to her ankles...so she would sink.

|-|(Didn't talk to Toad and TJ)=

'''Snow:''' There were cinderblocks tied to her ankles.<br />

'''Bufkin:''' Cinderblocks?<br />

'''Bigby:''' So she would sink.

</tabber>

'''Bufkin:''' Oh.

Bigby examines the corpse's fist.

'''Bigby:''' Her fist is clenched.

'''Snow:''' So she fought back?

'''Bigby:''' No marks on the knuckles.

'''Snow:''' Oh.

'''Bufkin:''' Maybe she was grabbing something.

'''Snow:''' Maybe...

Bigby tries to open her hand, but fails.

<tabber>[Pry open her fist]=

'''Snow:''' What are you doing?<br />

'''Bigby:''' Only way to find out.<br />

Bigby pries open her first. Flowers are resting in her hand.<br />

'''Snow:''' Jesus, Bigby. What is it?<br />

Bigby picks up the lilac petals.<br />

'''Snow:''' Flowers?<br />

'''Bigby:''' Yeah.

|-|[Leave it alone]=

Bigby backs off.

</tabber>

Bigby examines the corpse's track marks on her legs.

'''Bigby:''' Track marks.

'''Snow:''' She used Mundy drugs?

'''Bigby:''' Looks that way. Pretty heavily too. I hear they only go for the legs if they've used up the veins in their arms...or if they're trying to hide the marks. Anyway, it means it's not a perfect match to your leg. Unless...

'''Snow:''' Don't be ridiculous.

'''Bigby:''' Maybe she was trying to compensate with that perfume.

'''Snow:''' Wait. If the glamour is supposed to make her look like me, shouldn't it be concealing things like track marks? That brooch too. Why would it change everything else? I've never seen one this sloppy.

<tabber>It might be a cheap glamour.=

'''Bigby:''' It might be a cheap one...just to get the job done.

|-|It might be failing.=

TBC

|-|It might be designed not to.=

'''Bigby:''' It's possible it's designed not to.<br />

'''Snow:''' Designed not to hide track marks?<br />

'''Bigby:''' Good point.

|-|...=

'''Snow:''' It looks like it's failing, but glamours aren't supposed to do that.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' The witches upstairs know what they're doing, that's why they cost so much. Unless someone is making glamours illegally?

'''Bufkin:''' It's not technically illegal, miss. It's not encouraged, for sure, but there aren't any laws specifically forbidding it.

'''Bigby:''' So there's some sort of black market for glamours?

'''Bufkin:''' One would assume so. I imagine anyone with the proper books and training could theoretically produce a glamour.

'''Snow:''' Yet another thing to worry about. Black market or not, it's a pretty good match. Look at that. The buttons aren't exact either. There's an extra one...here.

Bigby examines the coat buttons.

'''Bigby:''' You're right. These buttons are wrong. I wonder...

'''Snow:''' What?

<tabber>I need to open her coat.=

'''Bigby:''' Snow, I need to open her coat.<br />

'''Snow:''' Bigby. Just...let me.

'''Bigby:''' Snow, do you mind if I...open her coat?<br />

'''Snow:''' Bigby. Just let me do it.

|-|Nothing, forget it.=

Snow unbuttons the coat.

Crane walks up to the group.

'''Crane:''' What have you found out? Well?

<tabber>Her glamour isn't perfect.=

'''Bigby:''' Her glamour is defective.<br />

'''Crane:''' Oh. Defective?<br />

'''Snow:''' We're thinking it's black market. We should really be regulating this kind of thing.<br />

'''Crane:''' Yes.

|-|She was a drug user.=

'''Bigby:''' She was using Mundy drugs. Pretty heavily too, judging by the track marks on her legs.<br />

'''Crane:''' Track marks? Isn't there...there are diseases...<br />

'''Snow:''' I don't think she has to worry about that now.<br />

'''Crane:''' No...no, of course not.

|-|I'm not finished.=

'''Bigby:''' I haven't finished yet.<br />

'''Crane:''' Well, get on with it, then. We can't waste too much time here. The killer might be preparing another attack as we speak.

'''Crane:''' Well, get on with it, then. We can't waste too much time here. The killer might be preparing another attack as we speak.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' We should keep going.

Bigby examines the lingerie.

'''Bigby:''' Are you wearing silk lingerie, Snow?

'''Snow:''' Why do you want to know?

'''Bigby:''' I'm just trying to see if the clothes are exact.

'''Snow:''' They're not.

Bigby uses the bottom coat pocket. He finds a bottle labeled "use this".

'''Crane:''' What is that?

<tabber>(Checked neck marks)=

'''Bigby:''' She had the perfume with her.

|-|(Didn't check neck marks)=

'''Bigby:''' It's your perfume.<br />

'''Snow:''' How do you know what perfume I wear.<br />

'''Bigby:''' You can't fool this nose.

{{#tag:tabber|(Examined perfume bottle)=

'''Bigby:''' Also, I saw the bottle on your desk.

}}

</tabber>

'''Bigby:''' Looks like someone picked it out for her.

'''Snow:''' So someone gave her instructions?

Bigby uses the top coat pocket. He finds a cylindrical container.

'''Snow:''' I've seen things like this before... It's definitely magic, though witches don't usually craft objects these days.

'''Crane:''' I don't think it's wise to fool around with that. It's some kind of black market magic, who knows what it could do? We should have it looked at. Just to make sure it isn't dangerous. Don't you think?

<tabber>Quiet, Crane.=

'''Bigby:''' Will you keep quiet?

|-|You worry too much.=

'''Bigby:''' You worry too much, Crane.

|-|Let's find out.=

'''Bigby:''' You may be right. One way to find out.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

Bigby shakes the container.

'''Bigby:''' Hmm.

'''Crane:''' What?

'''Bigby:''' There's something in here.

'''Snow:''' How do we open it?

<tabber>I can figure it out.=

'''Bigby:''' I think I can figure it out. Something to do with these rings here.

|-|Might want to stand back.=

'''Bigby:''' Might want to stand back if you're worried, Crane. I'm gonna try to open it. Something to do with these rings here.

|-|Not sure yet.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm not sure yet. Something to do with these rings here.

|-|...=

'''Snow:''' I assume it would have something to do with those rings on it?

</tabber>

Bigby turns the rings until they form a picture of a deer, and the container unlocks.

'''Snow:''' A deer? What does that mean?

Bigby takes off the lid.

'''Snow:''' Oh!

Bigby pours the contents of the container onto the pedestal. He examines the lock of hair.

<tabber>(Examined photo)=

'''Snow:''' Let me guess, it's my hair.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Yeah.

|-|(Didn't examine photo)=

'''Snow:''' Is that...?<br />

'''Bigby:''' It's your hair.

</tabber>

Bigby examines the rolled photograph and opens it to reveal a torn picture of Snow. She takes it from Bigby.

'''Snow:''' Someone must've taken this from my apartment. I noticed it was missing, but I didn't think... This was the last picture I had of Rose and me. My sister and I don't talk much anymore.

Snow turns and takes a few steps away from the pedestal.

'''Snow:''' Who did this, Bigby?

The corpse glows as the glamour fades away.

'''Snow:''' Oh, my god.

'''Bufkin:''' She's a troll?!

'''Crane:''' You've gotta be kidding me.

<tabber>Holy shit.=

'''Bigby:''' Holy shit.<br />

'''Snow:''' Well, that helps explain the glamour. Kind of.

|-|Yes, she's a troll.=

'''Bigby:''' Yeah, she's a troll. Can we move on?

|-|Calm down.=

'''Bigby:''' Alright, you can calm down. It's not like you haven't seen a troll before.

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' Who is she?

Snow notices a tattoo on her leg.

'''Snow:''' That wasn't there before. Who do you think she is? I don't know many trolls, I'm afraid.

'''Crane:''' Should've left them all back in the Homelands.

'''Snow:''' You don't mean that, do you?

<tabber>Holly the bartender?=

'''Bigby:''' She looks like Holly.<br />

'''Snow:''' The owner of the Trip Trap? No, she looks a little... Oh, no.<br />

'''Bigby:''' What?<br />

'''Snow:''' It's not Holly, it's her sister Lily.

|-|Maybe Holly knows.=

'''Bigby:''' Maybe Holly knows.<br />

'''Snow:''' The owner of the Trip Trap? No, she looks a little... Oh, no.<br />

'''Bigby:''' What?<br />

'''Snow:''' It's not Holly, it's her sister Lily.

'''Snow:''' She was reported missing, but I...I guess it just slipped through the cracks.

'''Bigby:''' We have to go tell Holly.

'''Snow:''' Right. She might know something about this. Who Lily was seeing...

'''Crane:''' Certainly another troll.

'''Crane:''' He's in charge of this investigation.<br />

==The Trip Trap Bar==

''The Trip Trap Bar''<br />''The Bronx''<br />''Early Evening''

[[Jack Horner (Video Game)|Jack Horner]], [[Grendel (Video Game)|Gren]], and [[Holly (Video Game)|Holly]] are gathered in the Trip Trap. Gren is determinantly missing an arm.

'''Gren:''' This whole thing is complete bullshit and always has been. I mean, what's his job, really?

'''Holly:''' To keep shit from reaching the Woodlands. Jack, I don't know where they are.

'''Jack:''' You're a bar, you're supposed to have darts around.

'''Holly:''' And I normally do, but who knows where the fuck they went to after--

Bigby and determinantly Snow enter the bar.

'''Jack:''' C'mon, Holly, I need entertainment.

Jack turns around and sees Bigby.

'''Jack:''' This'll do.

Holly puts away a bottle of alcohol and several glasses.

<tabber>You can relax.=

'''Bigby:''' Okay, okay, I know, just relax. I'm not here to start anything.<br />

'''Holly:''' Okay.

'''Bigby:''' What are you guys talking about?<br />

'''Holly:''' What the fuck do you think?

'''Jack:''' Miss White. I heard you had kind of a strange morning...<br />

'''Snow:''' It's been "kind of a strange morning" for everyone, I think.

</tabber>

Jack puts his arm around Bigby.

'''Jack:''' Every time I see this guy, he seems to lose weight. It's amazing, it really is. he loses weight and yet somehow keeps all the muscle.

'''Bigby:''' Jack...

'''Jack:''' Wolfie, my dear, how are you?

Bigby walks away from Jack and up to the bar counter.

'''Jack:''' Because, you know, we were just talking about you. All of us. At the bar, here. About you.

<tabber>Not too good.=

'''Bigby:''' Not too good right now.<br />

'''Jack:''' Well, that's sad to hear. Me? Oh, I'm great, as usual.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Uh-huh.

'''Bigby:''' I just need to talk to Holly. Privately.<br />

'''Jack:''' Alright, just give us a second first.

|-|Not now, Jack.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm really not in the mood right now.<br />

'''Jack:''' Well, I was in the mood to play darts, so...I guess nobody's getting what they want!

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Jack:''' I'm dying to hear about the body that came out of the East River this morning. It was a Fable, right? Oh, everyone knows.

'''Gren:''' The toad was just here.<br />

'''Jack:''' He said it looked like Snow White.

{{#tag:tabber|(Brought Snow along)=

'''Jack:''' That true, love?<br />

'''Snow:''' Yes. It's true.

'''Jack:''' So we were just wondering why--of all the possible suspects in Fabletown--why would arrest the poor ol' Woodsman, who you know had nothing to do with these murders?

</tabber>

'''Jack:''' Bigby, c'mon, you can't be so dumb as to--

'''Holly:''' Jack. Find the off button. Now.

'''Jack:''' What is it with you two? You and Gren are all, "Let's get a posse together," when there's no one around, but as soon as the Big Bad Wolf walks in, your tails go between your legs.

<tabber>(Ripped off Gren's arm)=

'''Jack:''' He fucking maimed you. Aren't you pissed?

</tabber>

'''Jack:''' Cat got your nerve? What happened?

'''Holly:''' What happened? I'm tired is what happened.

'''Jack:''' Tired of what?

'''Holly:''' Of trouble, Jack. I'm sick and tired of trouble. I don't want any more. So just stop revving his motor, or wait outside, or the fuck the hell off, I don't care which.

'''Gren:''' Holly's sister.

'''Jack:''' Holly's sister has been missing for, what, a few days now? And we haven't heard word one about it from anyone.

<tabber>[Throw Jack out]=

Bigby grabs Jack.<br />

'''Jack:''' Hey, easy!<br />

Bigby throws Jack against the pool table.<br />

''Jack will remember that.''<br />

'''Jack:''' Ow! Fuck! What'd I do? It's an honest question!

'''Gren:''' If you say one more fucking thing, just one more thing...<br />

Jack shrugs and walks away.

'''Gren:''' God-fucking-damn it! Of course the dear Princess Snow fucking White is all safe and sound!

Holly takes out a glass and a bottle of alcohol

'''Gren:''' Where were you when we reported this weeks ago, huh? Where are you when we ever fucking need you?! If you'd given one ounce of a shit about her, about any of us, she might've been saved! She might've been cared for! She might've been--

Holly crushes the glass and bottle.

<tabber>(Didn't bring Snow along)=

'''Gren:''' Alright, I think that's--<br />

Snow enters the bar.<br />

'''Gren:''' For fuck's sake. What could you possibly want right now?

{{#tag:tabber|Why are you here?=

'''Bigby:''' What are you doing here?<br />

''Snow noticed that.''<br />

'''Snow:''' I know you told me to stay put, but... I'm sorry, Bigby, I just can't. I have to do something. I'm not-- I'm not sitting in the office all day. I have to help.

'''Snow:''' Holly?

'''Holly:''' Get the fuck out of my bar.

'''Snow:''' I just want to--

'''Holly:''' It should have been you. It should have been you and it wasn't.

Snow hands Holly the brooch.

'''Snow:''' We recovered this from her personal effects. I thought you might like to have it.

'''Holly:''' I...I didn't know she still had this. The copper was from a dwarf mine... It's very rare...and very old.

<tabber>Good call, Snow.=

'''Bigby:''' That was decent of you.

'''Bigby:''' I wish we had time to reminisce, but...we really don't.<br />

'''Snow:''' It's quite lovely.

'''Holly:''' Gren?

'''Gren:''' Yeah?

'''Holly:''' Take off for a bit, would ya?

'''Gren:''' Are you sure?

Holly looks at Gren expectantly, and he leaves the bar, determinantly with Jack (if Bigby didn't throw him out). Holly sets a drink down on the counter.

'''Holly:''' I don't know that much about her life...honestly, we didn't talk often.

Holly takes a drink, then sits down on a barstool.

'''Holly:''' She was lost here, in the city. She just got swept away by it.

<tabber>Why weren't you talking?=

'''Bigby:''' Why were you two not talking?<br />

'''Holly:''' It seems so fucking petty now, but I just--I didn't want to watch her wither. I think she was off the Mundy drugs, but...

|-|Who might know more?=

'''Bigby:''' Did she have any friends? Anyone who could tell us what she might have been doing? Why she'd be a target?<br />

'''Holly:''' I don't know about her friends...she hung around where she worked, mostly.

|-|Why was Lily glamoured?=

'''Bigby:''' Do you have any idea why she'd be glamoured as Snow White?<br />

'''Holly:''' What? Oh, god. I'm sorry. That was probably about...

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Holly:''' She was hooking. To pay down debt. It ate me up to see her that way. Eventually, the only people she owed were at her work, you know, that shithole club. The Pudding 'n' Pie. The owner, Georgie, with all his fuckin' "fees", it's a crock of shit. It's how they kept her under their thumb, really.

'''Snow:''' Holly, it's okay. If it's too much, we don't have to do this.

<tabber>Pudding and Pie?=

'''Bigby:''' Pudding and Pie, huh? What do you know about the place?<br />

'''Holly:''' It's a real garbage dump.<br />

'''Snow:''' We can just go check it out.

'''Bigby:''' Georgie, huh?

{{#tag:tabber|(Went to Lawrence first)=

'''Bigby:''' What do you know about him?<br />

'''Snow:''' We can just go talk to him.

|-|Fees?=

'''Bigby:''' Fees, huh? What kind of fees?<br />

'''Snow:''' Sounds like one of those old "company store" kinds of ploys, designed to entrap people by keeping them in debt. We can probably learn more at the club.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' We've got a lead. Maybe we can take it from here?

'''Holly:''' Lily...

<tabber>I'll look into that.=

(If Bigby went after Dee.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' That's helpful. I'll check into it.

|-|The Woodsman was seeing Lily.=

(If Bigby went after Woody.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' Did you know the Woodsman was, um, "seeing" Lily regularly?<br />

'''Holly:''' What? He was?<br />

'''Bigby:''' I'm only bringing it up on the off chance it could...jog your memory.<br />

'''Holly:''' Of all the fuckin' things... No, there's nothin' more I can give you.

|-|Anything else you can tell us?=

'''Bigby:''' Anything else you can tell us?<br />

'''Holly:''' I don't think so. Like I said, we didn't talk much.<br />

'''Snow:''' That's alright. You've been more than helpful.

|-|Anything we can do?=

'''Bigby:''' Thanks for everything, Holly. Is there, um, is there anything we can do to...?<br />

'''Holly:''' No, no, I'm better off dealin' with things alone. I don't need sympathy and I don't need charity.<br />

'''Snow:''' It's not charity, it's looking out for our own.

|-|...=

'''Snow:''' Well, you've been a tremendous help, truly.

</tabber>

'''Holly:''' Is she...where is she?

'''Snow:''' She's at the Business Office. She's taken care of.

'''Holly:''' I'm gonna have to go down there and get her. Fuck.

'''Snow:''' Please, we can handle the funeral arrangements...

'''Holly:''' No, no, it's--it's a kind of--it's a formality with trolls. We burn our dead by sunrise or...I dunno. Some old world shit will fuck your soul up.

<tabber>Her body is evidence.=

'''Bigby:''' Holly, Lily's the best evidence we have right now. We can't surrender her body 'til I know it can't help the case anymore.<br />

''You refused to give Holly the body.''<br />

'''Holly:''' This is really important to me.<br />

'''Bigby:''' And the investigation is important to everyone.<br />

'''Snow:''' Look, why don't you come down with me to the Business Office, and we'll see what we can do?

|-|I'll check with Crane.=

'''Bigby:''' I'll check with the deputy mayor about that. He'd want to be kept in the loop.<br />

''You promised to check with Crane.''<br />

'''Holly:''' This is really important to me.<br />

'''Snow:''' Look, why don't you come down with me to the Business Office, and we'll see what we can do?

|-|You can have her body.=

'''Bigby:''' Of course.<br />

'''Holly:''' Okay. Good.<br />

''You promised Holly the body.''<br />

'''Snow:''' Let's go down to the Business Office and start making the necessary preparations, alright?

|-|...=

'''Snow:''' Of course. That should be fine. Let's go down to the Business Office and start making the necessary preparations, alright?

</tabber>

Holly and Snow walk toward the door. Snow stops in front of Bigby.

'''Snow:''' That club?

'''Bigby:''' I'll go down there now, see what I can find out from the owner.

<tabber>(Was nice to Holly)=

'''Snow:''' You were good with her, I'm impressed. Really. Thanks. It just made everything easier.

|-|(Was mean to Holly)=

'''Snow:''' When you come back to the office, please try to make more of an effort with her. Just do it for me. It makes everything easier.

Snow and Holly leave the bar. Bigby walks away a moment later.

''The Pudding & Pie''<br />''The Bronx''<br />''Evening''

Bigby's taxi pulls to a stop in front of the club, and he gets out. [[Vivian]] stubs out her cigarette with her shoe and walks up to him.

'''Vivian:''' Oh! Sheriff. What a nice surprise. I'm not sure I've seen you here before. You're always welcome, of course. Is it business, or pleasure? Or both?

Vivian opens the door, and she and Bigby start walking down the hallway.

'''Vivian:''' Welcome to the Pudding and Pie, where we cater to the diverse tastes of the Fable community. Your pleasure is our pleasure. Your desires are our desires. Your imagination is the menu, and discretion is our guarantee.

'''Georgie:''' You're supposed to turn the clients on. That's your job!

'''Georgie:''' You want them to feel happy!

'''Georgie:''' You want them to think YOU feel happy!

'''Georgie:''' You want them to forget about your shoulders and those fucking narrow hips!

'''Georgie:''' You want them to get so worked up that they'll stuff their wallets straight up your fucking cunt!

'''Georgie:''' You want them so out of their minds blind with excitement that they'll hock their houses and carpet this floor with money just to get their grimy little paws on you!

'''Georgie:''' But they're not gonna do any of that if you don't ever flash them a bloody SMILE!

'''Georgie:''' You know what they're gonna do? They're gonna take their business elsewhere, because you're making them feel fucking MISERABLE!

'''Georgie:''' You're supposed to be reeling them in, instead you're driving them out the fucking door!

'''Georgie:''' What do you want, then? You here for a little taste?

Nerissa crosses her arms over her chest.

'''Georgie:''' Tell you what, come back after midnight, maybe. I can hook you up. Or...knowing you...she's probably not quite your style. You'd prefer someone who can take a bit of a beating. Tell me, do you prefer a stationary target, or one that will put up a fight? I can arrange whatever you like, for the right price.

'''Georgie:''' Of course she was, you daft git. She was a troll.

'''Bigby:''' No. I mean glamoured to look like another Fable.

'''Georgie:''' Yeah? Well, so what? Who gives a toss? People get up to all kinds of things when nobody's watching. It's their own business.

<tabber>It's sick.=

'''Bigby:''' It's sick.<br />

'''Georgie:''' Hah! That's quaint. Especially coming from you. The thirteenth floor would never provide a glamour like that. It's strictly black market stuff.<br />

'''Georgie:''' Ooh, black market, is it? How exciting!

|-|It's illegal.=

'''Bigby:''' You know it's illegal to impersonate another Fable.<br />

'''Georgie:''' It's frowned on.<br />

'''Bigby:''' It's illegal, as long as I don't like it. The thirteenth floor would never provide a glamour like that. It's strictly black market stuff.<br />

'''Georgie:''' Ooh, black market, is it? How exciting!

|-|You're behind it.=

'''Bigby:''' I think you're behind this. You got her a black market glamour as part of some twisted sex fantasy.<br />

'''Georgie:''' Ooh, black market, is it? How exciting!

|-|...=

'''Georgie:''' Is this some great strategy to get me to incriminate myself? Brilliant.

</tabber>

'''Georgie:''' This is exactly what I would expect from a thug like you. Storm in, throw around a bunch of accusations, try to scare people, but you've got fuck all to back it up. Pfft. And we're all just meant to jump any time the wolf shows his teeth. He used to be something, you know. Now look at him.

<tabber>[Show him the glamour box]=

'''Bigby:''' Nothing to back it up? What the fuck is this, then?!<br />

Bigby takes out the glamour box.<br />

'''Georgie:''' Get that out of my face.<br />

'''Bigby:''' I found it on Lily's body. It's definitely a back-alley job. Where did she get it?<br />

'''Georgie:''' You've got this all wrong. If Lily was doing a special glamour, it wasn't for ME! For fuck's sake, I want that kind of heat?<br />

'''Bigby:''' Who was she doing it for, then?<br />

'''Georgie:''' She had clients, Bigby.

|-|[Show him Snow's photo]=

Bigby takes out the photo of Snow.<br />

'''Georgie:''' Get that out of my face.<br />

'''Bigby:''' This was part of the glamour we found on Lily's body! Take a good look! She was impersonating Snow White, WHY?<br />

'''Georgie:''' You've got this all wrong. If Lily was doing a special glamour, it wasn't for ME! For fuck's sake, I want that kind of heat?<br />

'''Bigby:''' This was part of the glamour we found on Lily's body! Take a good look! She was impersonating Snow White, WHY?<br />

'''Georgie:''' Whoa, hey, if you say so. Just looks like hair to me. Anyway, even supposing she WAS doing a special glamour, it wasn't for me. I don't need the trouble.<br />

'''Bigby:''' For who, then?<br />

'''Georgie:''' I don't know. She had clients.

|-|[Don't show him anything] / ...=

'''Georgie:''' Anyway, even supposing she WAS doing a special glamour, it wasn't for me. I don't need the trouble.<br />

</tabber>

'''Georgie:''' Maybe one of them was into it. Lot of fucked up people in Fabletown.

'''Bigby:''' Like who?

'''Georgie:''' Try looking in a mirror. Anyway, nowt to do with me.

Georgie turns his boombox back on.

'''Georgie:''' Go on, then.

Nerissa continues dancing.

<tabber>We're not done here.=

'''Bigby:''' We're not done here.<br />

'''Georgie:''' I think we are.<br />

'''Bigby:''' I said we're NOT!

'''Bigby:''' Turn that shit OFF.

|-|[Turn it off] / ...=

Bigby says nothing.

Bigby steps toward the boombox, but Georgie stands up and blocks his way.

'''Georgie:''' You gonna hit me? Go ahead. That's what you wanna do, right? That's what you came here for, right? That's what you like!

<tabber>[Punch him]=

Bigby punches Georgie in the face.<br />

''Georgie will remember that.''

|-|Who hired her?=

'''Bigby:''' One more time. Who. Hired. Her?<br />

Georgie raises his fist to punch Bigby, but loses his balance and stumbles backward.

|-|I'll shut this place down!=

'''Bigby:''' Tell me what I want to know, or I will shut this whole place DOWN.<br />

Georgie raises his fist to punch Bigby, but loses his balance and stumbles backward.

Georgie raises his fist to punch Bigby, but loses his balance and stumbles backward.

Georgie bumps into the boombox, knocking it onto the ground.

'''Georgie:''' AW, NO! FUCK!

Nerissa stops dancing and looks worried.

'''Georgie:''' YOU! Take your sad fucking face where I can't see it!

Nerissa walks away.

'''Georgie:''' Blood bastard fucking shit! You proud of yourself, mate? Proud of your little mess? Fuck's sake.

[[Clever Hans]] walks over to the group. Georgie picks up the boombox and shoves it into Hans' arms.

'''Georgie:''' Fuck off, Hans.

Hans starts to walk away.

<tabber>Hey!=

'''Bigby:''' Hey!

|-|Hans, is it?=

'''Bigby:''' Hold on a minute. Hans, is it?

|-|I need to ask some questions.=

'''Bigby:''' I need to ask you a few questions.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

Hans sets the boombox down on a table.

'''Georgie:''' Hans just cleans up and provides a little muscle when we need it. He's not gonna know anything about the girls and their clients or any of that. No one knows, don't you get it? It's by design. "Discretion is our guarantee," right? And the way we guarantee that is that no one knows anything they don't have to know. Including me. I cover my eyes and take my cut, end of story.

'''Hans:''' Why not look it up?

'''Bigby:''' What's that?

'''Hans:''' Isn't there a little book with all the stuff about the girls and all that written in it?

'''Georgie:''' You're a fucking moron!

'''Bigby:''' Show me.

'''Georgie:''' There is no book.

Georgie picks up a cricket bat labeled "CROWD CONTROL".

'''Georgie:''' And as for you, Hans, we need to work on your communication skills, and I've a fairly good idea where to start.

Bigby takes the bat from Georgie.

'''Georgie:''' Here, that's my personal property!

Bigby slams the bat onto the counter.

'''Georgie:''' Haha! Sure, go ahead. Do what comes naturally.

Bigby moves the bat down the counter, knocking over the cups on top of it.

<tabber>Tell me about the book.=

'''Bigby:''' Tell me about the book.<br />

'''Georgie:''' You haven't got the slightest clue about anything!

|-|[Smash boombox]=

Bigby smashes the boombox with the bat.<br />

''Georgie will remember that.''<br />

'''Georgie:''' Aw, no, NO, NO! You unbelievable prick!

|-|...=

Bigby does nothing.

</tabber>

Bigby moves toward Georgie, who backs away.

'''Georgie:''' Hey, now...

<tabber>I want that book.=

'''Bigby:''' Cut the crap, Georgie. I want the book Hans is talking about.<br />

'''Georgie:''' Hans is confused. Again.

|-|[Break cigarette machine]=

Bigby smashes the machine with the bat. A pack of cigarettes falls out.<br />

'''Georgie:''' You shouldn't have messed with that.

|-|...=

Bigby does nothing.

</tabber>

Georgie moves behind the counter, near the TV, and Bigby follows.

'''Georgie:''' Don't even think about it.

<tabber>Just tell me where it is.=

'''Bigby:''' Look, Georgie, why don't you just tell me where the book is?<br />

'''Georgie:''' Can we please NOT go round and round about this? There's no book. End of story.

|-|[Destroy TV]=

Bigby smashes the TV.<br />

'''Georgie:''' Jesus fuck!

|-|...=

Bigby does nothing.

</tabber>

Bigby puts his foot on a keg and tilts it over slightly.

'''Georgie:''' Do NOT touch that. You hear me? That's nothing to do with you.

<tabber>Hand it over while you still can.=

'''Bigby:''' There's still time for you to just cough it up.<br />

'''Georgie:''' I'm sorry, Sheriff, but there's no handy magic book with everything you want to know jotted down inside. I sincerely wish there was. Maybe it would get you off my back.<br />

Bigby moves the keg off a hatch in the floor.

|-|[Wreck keg]=

Bigby kicks the keg into the wall.

|-|...=

Bigby moves the keg off a hatch in the floor.

</tabber>

'''Bigby:''' Well, well, what's this? Looks like a floor safe.

'''Georgie:''' I wouldn't know. It was here when we moved in, I don't have a key to it. Sheriff, will you come on! Fuck's sake, I've gotta open in a few hours!

<tabber>Give me the book!=

'''Bigby:''' Give it to me.<br />

'''Georgie:''' You're a big bad bastard! We get it! Everyone's guilty! We fucking get it.

|-|[Hurt Georgie]=

Bigby hits Georgie in the stomach with the bat.<br />

''Georgie will remember that.''<br />

'''Georgie:''' Was it good for you, "Sheriff"? Next time I'm gonna have to charge you.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

Georgie backs toward the wall as Bigby advances.

'''Georgie:''' Jesus! You're killing me! I'm begging you! I'll pay you!

<tabber>People are dead!=

'''Bigby:''' Two women are dead!<br />

'''Georgie:''' Then quit being a bloody idiot.

|-|[Smash sign]=

Bigby smashes the neon sign with the bat.<br />

'''Georgie:''' Fuck's sake.

|-|...=

Bigby does nothing.

</tabber>

Bigby approaches the DJ booth.

'''Georgie:''' C'mon, mate. Leave it. There's nothing there for you.

<tabber>I'll destroy this place.=

'''Bigby:''' You might want to stand back.<br />

''Georgie won't forget that.''<br />

'''Georgie:''' Alright, alright, ALRIGHT.

|-|[Demolish DJ booth]=

Bigby smashes the booth with the bat, then the throws the booth to the ground.<br />

'''Georgie:''' Aw, for--! This is a dance club! What the hell am I supposed to do tonight while the girls are on stage? Harmonica? Kazoo? Whistle a happy tune? Fucking unbelievable.<br />

''Georgie won't forget that.''

|-|...=

'''Georgie:''' Alright, alright, ALRIGHT.

</tabber>

Georgie takes out a key.

'''Georgie:''' Bloody come on, then!

<tabber>(Destroyed the place)=

'''Georgie:''' Fucking trash my business over this bullshit. Protector of Fabletown, my ass. What a load of crap.

|-|(Didn't destroy the place)=

'''Georgie:''' Prick.

</tabber>

Bigby and Georgie walk toward the floor safe.

'''Georgie:''' Once again, don't get your hopes up. There's nothin' in here that'll tell you anything--but it's a kick to the balls for me and my club, so you can be happy about that.

Georgie unlocks the safe and hands the book to Bigby. He sets it on the counter and searches through the names.

'''Bigby:''' Here. This is Lily's last entry. So tell me, Georgie, who's this Mister Smith?

'''Georgie:''' Oh, dear. I'm afraid it might be a fake name, Bigby. Secrecy is sort of how this all works. Even Hans knows that.

'''Bigby:''' What's "207"? Room number?

'''Georgie:''' I don't fucking know, millimeters, maybe?

'''Bigby:''' Don't bullshit me, Georgie! This is YOUR book! YOUR girls!

'''Georgie:''' But I'm not their fucking secretary. I give them a stage, I give them music, I provide an "erotic venue to attract and retain clients..." But let's be clear on something--the girls make the arrangements with their clients! Not me. The girls. They're the ones with the Mister Smiths, and Joneses, and Mister X types. Whatever happens outside the club--that's on them...

Bigby puts the book in his pocket. He sees Nerissa looking out from behind a nearby door.

'''Georgie:''' I log the business, take my cut, and I'm out. Now I've had quite enough of your bullying. Excuse me while I call your superiors to make a complaint.

Georgie takes out a phone and dials a number.

'''Georgie's Comments'''

'''Georgie:''' 'Allo, Business Office?

'''Georgie:''' Yeah, that's right.

'''Georgie:''' I want to talk to the deputy mayor.

'''Georgie:''' I don't give a rat's ass about that, just fuck off and fetch him for me, alright?

'''Georgie:''' No, I don't want to--

'''Georgie:''' Fine, I'll hold.

'''Georgie:''' What's that?

'''Georgie:''' Porgie. It's Georgie Porgie.

'''Georgie:''' I wouldn't be calling if it wasn't important, would I?

'''Georgie:''' His fucking subordinate's down here harassing me, that's what.

'''Georgie:''' "Subordinate".

'''Georgie:''' Look, I don't care if you know what it means or not. What possible difference could that make? Because all you're going to do is to go and get him, and put him on the bloody phone with me. That's all you have to do!

'''Georgie:''' Alright, alright.

'''Georgie:''' Yes, fine, I can--

'''Georgie:''' Fuck's sake.

'''Georgie:''' Yes, but have you found him?

'''Georgie:''' I'm aware of that.

'''Georgie:''' Well, how fucking long could that possibly take?

'''Georgie:''' Yes, but this is important. He's here in my club, stirring up trouble.

'''Georgie:''' Yes, I do, but I want to do it in person, on the phone, right now!

'''Georgie:''' No, I don't think you understand.

'''Talk to Georgie'''

'''Bigby:''' Georgie.

Georgie gives Bigby the middle finger.

'''Beauty:''' That's all we get are Smiths, Joneses, or Johnsons. I think the last ones are jokes.

|-|Do you know Tweedle Dee?=

(If Bigby went after Dee.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' I talked to Tweedle Dee earlier today... He mentioned you in passing. Do you know him...or his brother?<br />

'''Beauty:''' I took out a loan for backpay--it was like our third notice--and ever since then those annoying freaks have been pestering me for the money plus interest.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Why take out a loan from those two?<br />

'''Beauty:''' It was from the Crooked Man.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Beauty...<br />

'''Beauty:''' You don't know how desperate I was, Bigby! I had nowhere else to go!<br />

'''Bigby:''' Look, if this ever happens again...come see me, or Snow, first, alright?<br />

'''Beauty:''' I tried.

|-|Have you seen Snow here?=

'''Bigby:''' Have you seen Snow White down here? Or maybe somebody glamoured as her?<br />

'''Beauty:''' You know, it's funny. I did see someone who I thought looked a lot like her, but...she didn't say anything when she saw me, even though she knew that I saw her. I just assumed it wasn't Snow and went about my business.

|-|[Go up to room]=

Bigby drops his cigarette on the floor.

After choosing to go up to the room, Bigby stubs out his cigarette with his shoe.

'''Bigby:''' Thanks.

'''Beauty:''' Wait. It'll be better if anyone sees you that they at least see you with me, so they know I didn't let you just wander around by yourself.

Beauty walks out from behind the reception desk.

'''Beauty:''' Five minutes? Please?

'''Bigby:''' We'll see, Beauty.

'''Beauty:''' Just be ready to act like I'm trying to kick you out.

'''Bigby:''' That won't be hard.

Bigby and Beauty go upstairs.

'''Beauty:''' Listen, Bigby, I assume you'll be filing some kind of an official report or something, which is fine, it's just that, I was wondering, if...I need to be in it? Do you have to mention my name? I mean, it's--it's not like Beast would ever see your report, it's just... Well, you never know.

<tabber>No problem.=

'''Bigby:''' Don't worry about it. The less I have to write down, the better.<br />

'''Beauty:''' Thanks. I appreciate it.

|-|You want me to lie.=

'''Bigby:''' You're asking me to lie?<br />

'''Beauty:''' Not lie, just not include my name. Just say you talked to the clerk or something. You'll do what you have to. I just want you to know that would help me.

'''Beauty:''' Sorry. No. It just seemed like every other night does. That's exactly what's bothering me. From now on, I'll just be down there imagining...this.

|-|How do I found out who rents the room?=

'''Bigby:''' How can I find out who rented this room?<br />

Bigby examines the apple.

'''Beauty:''' Do you smell something?

'''Bigby:''' No. Just apple.

Bigby picks up the apple, which has a single bite out of it.

<tabber>(Examined storybook)=

'''Bigby:''' Huh.<br />

'''Beauty:''' What? What are you thinking?

{{#tag:tabber|Murder makes him hungry.=

'''Bigby:''' There's a bite out of the apple. Could be "Mr. Smith" got hungry after he killed Lily, had himself a little snack.<br />

'''Beauty:''' Jesus. He really IS a cold-blooded sociopath, isn't he?

{{!}}-{{!}}It's like the apple in the book.=

'''Bigby:''' It's got a single bite taken out of it. Like in Snow's story.<br />

''You connected the evidence.''<br />

'''Beauty:''' Oh, no! Do you think it was poisoned?<br />

'''Bigby:''' It wasn't, I'd have smelled that. I think it's just a prop. It's here because they were acting out the scene in the book.<br />

'''Beauty:''' Of course. That makes perfect sense!

'''Bigby:''' There's only one bite taken out of the apple--whoever was eating it didn't get to finish. I think that might have been Lily--"Mr. Smith" attacked her while she was eating.<br />

Bigby opens the closet, which contains a torn costume dress.

'''Bigby:''' Someone's been rough with this dress; it's torn.

'''Beauty:''' Oh, no, she must have been wearing it! He killed her, and then he...took it back off--

'''Bigby:''' No. There's no blood on it. It must have been torn some other time.

<tabber>(Examined storybook)=

'''Beauty:''' Oh, no. There's more? What? What now?

{{#tag:tabber|Looks like a Snow costume.=

'''Bigby:''' This is the same dress as the one in the book about Snow. I think "Smith" was dressing Lily up in it, to recreate the Snow from the book.<br />

'''Beauty:''' I guess he wanted to get the details right. God, roleplaying as a person who really exists, who we know, that's just weird. I'm not sure who to feel worse for. Okay, no, I take that back.

'''Beauty:''' So, this freak made that poor girl dress up like Snow White, then cut her head off!

TBC

{{!}}-{{!}}He could be a cross-dresser.=

'''Bigby:''' We found Lily wearing something else; tailored after one of Snow's suits. It's possible that the dress is actually for "Mr. Smith" himself.

<tabber>(Connected all the evidence)=

'''Beauty:''' God, I can see the whole picture now! It all goes together, like you said! This creep put that girl in a Snow White dress and recreated the whole story from the book, with the apple, and the deep sleep, and everything! You're a better detective than I thought you'd be.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Thanks?<br />

'''Beauty:''' So, he planned it out, he had all the details noted down. Only, then, when it comes time to kiss her and wake her up...<br />

'''Bigby:''' Yeah.

'''Beauty:''' You're like a brick wall! How does she stand you?

</tabber>

'''Beauty:''' I hope you're just about through. I don't really want to stay in here any longer.

Bigby sees an envelope on the floor of the closet. He picks it up and opens it, taking out a photo of Snow standing on a bridge.

'''Beauty:''' Are those pictures of the dead girl?

Bigby takes out another photo.

'''Bigby:''' Not all of them.

'''Beauty:''' How do you know?

'''Bigby:''' I'm in this one. It was taken last winter.

Bigby points to the photo. It depicts him and Snow standing outside Cinderella's shoe store.

'''Beauty:''' Oh, no. Bigby... This kind of stalking...it doesn't just stop by itself. Trust me, I know about this, firsthand. He'll keep trying to get closer and closer.

'''Bigby:''' His stand-in for Snow is gone now, so...

'''Beauty:''' The next step closer...

Bigby takes out the last photo and looks horrified.

'''Beauty:''' What is it?

'''Bigby:''' It's Crane.

The photo shows Crane next to glamoured and dressed-up Lily lying on the bed. Back in the office, Crane watches Beauty and Bigby through the magic mirror. He smashes the glass with the lamp.

Bigby and Beauty start walking down the hallway.

'''Beauty:''' Crane? Ugh! God, you think you know a person. Bigby, you have to tell her.

'''Bigby:''' I know!

Bigby and Beauty walk downstairs into the lobby, where Beast is waiting.

'''Beast:''' What's going on? What did you find up there? You know, other than the...

Bigby picks up the phone in the lobby and starts dialing.

Bigby throws the broken phone to the floor.

'''Beauty:''' Whoa! Bigby, calm down. Everything's going to be fine, okay, it's gonna be fine.

'''Beast:''' Will someone please explain this to me?

'''Beauty:''' Crane has been stalking Snow White. The room was covered in evidence.

<tabber>Snow is in danger!=

'''Bigby:''' That perverted little fucker might be after Snow. I need to find her right now.<br />

'''Beauty:''' Okay, it's--it's going to be okay. Where did you see her last?

'''Beauty:''' Where did you see her last?

</tabber>

'''Beauty:''' Did she say where she was going?

'''Bigby:''' She took Holly to the Business Office...to prepare for the funeral.

'''Beast:''' Lily's funeral?

'''Bigby:''' Yeah.

'''Beauty:''' How do you know--

'''Beast:''' I was just at the Trip Trap, and I heard Gren telling some folks about a funeral at the Buckingham Bridge--

'''Beauty:''' The Trip Trap? Are you drinking--

'''Bigby:''' When?

'''Beast:''' Right now. They were on their way out.

Bigby leaves the hotel.

'''Beauty:''' Bigby!

Beauty runs out onto the street after Bigby.

'''Beauty:''' Wait!

'''Bigby:''' What?

'''Beauty:''' Snow's...Snow's been through a lot. There are things she doesn't talk about. Just...please be careful...when you tell her. And you should tell her, but...

<tabber>What do you mean?=

'''Bigby:''' What are you trying to say?

|-|I know.=

'''Bigby:''' I know.<br />

'''Beauty:''' No, you don't know.

Bigby says nothing.

'''Beauty:''' You know how you felt when you saw that picture? Well, it's going to be much worse for her. Just remember that.

Bigby walks away.

==The Buckingham Bridge==

''The Buckingham Bridge''<br />''10:28 PM''

Bigby steps out of a cab and enters the gate under the bridge. He approaches the gathering of people at the funeral. Snow is standing in front of them and delivering a eulogy. When she sees Bigby, she shakes her head at him.

'''Snow's Eulogy'''

'''Snow:''' I'm, um, honored to be asked to speak tonight. Even if it's tradition that everyone speak... Lily had many friends...but few Fables she was truly close to. If you're here...then you were a part of a very special circle. People she trusted and cared for. I won't...um, offend you...by claiming one day that...that the pain of losing Lily will ever subside. I know as well as you that it will never subside. But I also know that--that the memory of Lily will sustain as well. And it will, in time...equal in strength to our mourning her loss. And it is in that spirit that I'd like to talk about...what you've all been so grateful to share with me. Your memories of her. How she could be stubborn, and...patient. Rash and thoughtful. How she carried a torch for the "old ways", for tradition, for...um, pageantry. And most of all , it seems, how...Lily loved-- dearly loved--her friends and family. She loved being around them. In good times and bad. I never met Lily, but, from...what I've been told...I know, in my heart...that she would have liked to be here tonight. And now, we'll have our, um, moment of silence. Thank you.

<tabber>Sorry, this is important.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm sorry, Snow, but this is important. I--I have something to tell you.<br />

''You interrupted Snow's eulogy.''<br />

'''Snow:''' Really, Bigby? It's so important it can't wait fifteen minutes until it's maybe not at the worst possible time?

|-|We have to go.=

'''Bigby:''' Something's happened. We have to get out of here.<br />

''You interrupted Snow's eulogy.''<br />

'''Snow:''' Bigby, what the hell are you doing?!

|-|[Wave her over]=

Bigby shakes his head, but Snow shakes it no.

|-|[Don't interrupt] / ...=

Bigby says nothing.

'''Talk to Lawrence (Lawrence is alive)'''<br />

'''Bigby:''' Your highness...<br />

'''Lawrence:''' Oh, uh...Sheriff... I'm sorry, I, uh... I didn't see you there.

{{#tag:tabber|Did you know Lily?=

'''Bigby:''' Did you know the deceased? Lily?<br />

'''Lawrence:''' Oh, um, no. Not really. I just came 'cause it... I don't know. It just felt like a thing I should do, I guess.

{{!}}-{{!}}Why are you here?=

'''Bigby:''' What are you doing here?<br />

'''Lawrence:''' When I heard Holly's sister had been killed as well, it just felt like, uh, a thing I should do. I think they knew each other, Faith and Lily. I'm not sure, though.

{{!}}-{{!}}How are you holding up?=

'''Bigby:''' How are you holding up?<br />

'''Lawrence:''' About as well as you think. I haven't had any other, um... It's never been as bad as when you saw me, at least.

{{!}}-{{!}}...=

'''Lawrence:''' I, uh, I wasn't invited, but... It just felt like a thing I should do, I guess.

}}

'''Lawrence:''' I was angry, at first...when I heard that Lily was getting a funeral. That Holly was getting..."closure". I wanted that too. And I wanted it for Faith. But then I remembered...Faith lived a story Lily never did. She had her adventure, she got to live in the light of "forever after" with me...for a while. So let Lily have the better finish. It all evens out. In the end.

{{#tag:tabber|I'm sorry, Lawrence.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm sorry, Lawrence.<br />

'''Lawrence:''' I know, Sheriff. And thanks for saving my life.

{{!}}-{{!}}I'll get the killer.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm gonna get the guy who did this, Lawrence.<br />

'''Lawrence:''' Thank you, Bigby. And thanks for saving my life.

{{!}}-{{!}}It wasn't your fault.=

'''Bigby:''' None of this was your fault, Lawrence.<br />

'''Lawrence:''' It wasn't my fault, but...I didn't stop it.

'''Snow:''' Holly, wait, that was Crane, just Crane. He'd...disposed of Lily's body before Bigby could do anything about it. I'm telling you the truth.

'''Holly:''' Don't cover for him.

'''Snow:''' But this genuinely wasn't his fault.

'''Holly:''' You can't tell me Bigby gives a shit about this.

'''Vivian:''' Holly. It's gonna be okay.

<tabber>That's not important now.=

'''Bigby:''' Holly...this just isn't important right now. I need to talk to Snow.<br />

'''Snow:''' I do, or...I want to. But...you've got a hot head and a big heart, and sometimes that's not the best combination. Look, let's go back to the Business Office. I doubt Crane is there at this hour, but...we need to talk and this isn't the place.

{{!}}-{{!}}Crane took photos.=

'''Bigby:''' Crane has been taking photos, Snow. Lots of photos.<br />

'''Snow:''' Photos that show him...?<br />

'''Bigby:''' He's been...recording his "visits" with Lily.<br />

''Snow will remember that.''<br />

'''Snow:''' God... Look, let's go back to the Business Office. I doubt Crane is there at this hour, but...we need to talk and this isn't the place.

Nerissa walks up to the two of them.

'''Nerissa:''' Snow?

'''Snow:''' Nerissa. What is it?

'''Nerissa:''' I'm sorry, but Holly's asking for you.

'''Snow:''' Are they starting the burn?

'''Nerissa:''' Yes. Everyone who spoke should really be present for this part... She's kind of distraught. You're not leaving yet, are you?

'''Snow:''' Two minutes? I don't mean to be, um...

'''Nerissa:''' No, I understand.

'''Snow:''' It's just that something's come up.

<tabber>We should go.=

'''Bigby:''' We really should go.<br />

'''Snow:''' And we will, okay? Two minutes. This is important too.

|-|Are you okay?=

'''Bigby:''' Are you okay? You don't have to do this right now.<br />

'''Snow:''' I'll be fine.

|-|Take your time.=

'''Bigby:''' No, I get it. Take your time.<br />

'''Snow:''' It won't take long.

Bigby says nothing.

Snow walks away.

'''Nerissa:''' How'd it go? At the motel? Did you find anything? No?

<tabber>Lily was killed there.=

'''Bigby:''' Yeah... Lily was killed there. It was an awful mess.<br />

'''Nerissa:''' Oh...<br />

'''Bigby:''' I'm sorry.

|-|It was Crane's room.=

'''Bigby:''' It was Crane's room. But you knew that already, right?<br />

Nerissa nods.

|-|Yeah, thanks.=

'''Bigby:''' I, uh, did. It helped a lot. Thanks.

Bigby says nothing.

'''Vivian:''' Nerissa!

'''Nerissa:''' Yeah, um...coming!

Nerissa walks over to the others.

'''Dee:''' Constable.

Dee and Dum point their guns at Bigby's back.

'''Dee:''' Wait, wait, wait, easy now, girl. You know how this goes. The first thing in a visit? You say, "How do ya do?"

'''Dum:''' How do ya do?

'''Dee:''' That way, it's proper.

<tabber>What are you doing here?=

'''Bigby:''' What are you doing here?<br />

'''Dee:''' That is the question, isn't it?<br />

'''Dum:''' Or at least a question.

|-|Now is not the time.=

'''Bigby:''' Now is really not the time for whatever you jag-offs are planning to do.<br />

'''Dee:''' Well, isn't that the thing of it? Plans.<br />

'''Dum:''' Except it isn't our plans you should be concernin' yourself with.

|-|You're about to regret this.=

'''Bigby:''' I'd tell you to run, but it won't do any good. Just make it more fun for me.<br />

'''Dee:''' What're you dreamin' about? You ain't a fast enough pup to prevent me from emptying both barrels into Snow White's face over there.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>
<tabber>(Hurt Dee)=

'''Dee:''' I'm still hurtin', you know, from our "talk" in the cell. And I'll be honest, I'd love nothin' more than to carve a sweet poem right into your face for the sufferin' you've caused me...but I am a professional, and we're here for a job.

</tabber>

'''Dee:''' We'll snip to the chase, for all's sakes. A little bird told us that you're fittin' to go after Crane. And you see, we have an interest in that particular boy.

'''Dum:''' So you leave Crane alone, and we'll leave you alone.

'''Dee:''' Just take a little vacation, is all.

'''Dum:''' Don't even have to go anywhere.

'''Dee:''' Just sit in your office and whistle to Heaven for a few short days.

<tabber>Fuck off.=

'''Bigby:''' You have three seconds to fuck off before this goes to a place you don't want it to.<br />

'''Dee:''' Oh, I don't have my stopwatch on me.

|-|Don't do this here.=

'''Bigby:''' You're trying to pull this shit at a funeral? We can deal with this later.<br />

'''Dee:''' No, not later.<br />

'''Dum:''' Later's too late.<br />

'''Dee:''' Right now.

|-|You work for Crane?=

'''Bigby:''' Are you working for Crane? Did he send you?<br />

'''Dee:''' No, see now, you're already askin' too many questions. Just pay attention.

|-|...=

'''Dee:''' Is that a yes? I don't know.<br />

'''Dum:''' I don't know either.

</tabber>

'''Dee:''' So what's it gonna be? We have a deal? You leave Crane alone and we leave you to yours?

Holly notices the Tweedles and starts to approach them, along with the rest of the funeral-goers.

'''Dum:''' Brother...

'''Dee:''' Speak your mind. Fastly now. What's it gonna be?

<tabber>You think I'm scared?=

'''Bigby:''' You think this act you got going scares me? 'Cause it doesn't.<br />

'''Dee:''' Always wanting to do things the fun way...

|-|Fine, it's a deal.=

'''Bigby:''' Yeah, fine, I'll leave Crane alone, just get out of here.<br />

''You agreed to a deal.''<br />

'''Dum:''' Pleasure to hear it.

|-|Just don't hurt anyone.=

'''Bigby:''' Just don't hurt anyone, Dee.<br />

''They will remember that.''<br />

'''Dum:''' That don't sound like a yes to me.<br />

'''Dee:''' Always wanting to do things the fun way...

''They will remember that.''<br />

'''Dee:''' Always wanting to do things the fun way...

The group reaches Bigby and the Tweedles.

'''Dee:''' Ladies! Gentlemen! Invertebrates! Please! Rest easy, this is not--

'''Gren:''' What the hell is going on?

'''Snow:''' What's happening?

'''Dee:''' Very sorry to impose, but we only had a deal to work out with Bigby.

<tabber>(Took the deal)=

'''Dee:''' And we're happy to report that everything went smoothly, so if you'll just allow us to get out of your hair.

|-|(Didn't take the deal)=

'''Dee:''' And we're unhappy to report that things did not go as smoothly as planned.

'''Snow:''' Bigby, what is he talking about?

'''Dum:''' Never you mind that, it ain't any of your--

'''Gren:''' What deal?!

'''Dee:''' Settle down, settle down, now.

'''Dum:''' Yeah, everyone just stay where you are, nice and natural. Like we're just out havin' a spring picnic.

<tabber>It's about Crane.=

'''Bigby:''' They want me to leave Crane alone.<br />

'''Snow:''' Crane?<br />

'''Dee:''' Awww, now you shouldn't have done that, old boy, really.<br />

'''Dum:''' That wasn't right, tellin' everyone our dealings.

'''Bigby:''' Stop this shit. Right. Now.

(If Bigby didn't take the deal.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' I'm not making any deals with you, so just get the fuck out of here and leave these people alone.<br />

'''Dee:''' Naaaaah.

|-|Dee, time to leave.=

(If Bigby took the deal.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' I said alright already, just go.<br />

'''Dee:''' And go we shall, as men of our word.<br />

'''Dum''' We won't ruin any more of the wedding or whatever.

'''Dee:''' This is a private matter between Bigby and us, so if you all just please...

</tabber>

Holly and Gren remove their glamours.

'''Holly:''' What did I tell you? What did I say?

'''Bigby:''' Holly...

'''Gren:''' You think you motherfuckers can come here uninvited? You think you can just fuckin' interrupt Lily's funeral?!

The Tweedles point their guns at Gren and Holly.

'''Dee:''' Calm down, darling. It was just a simple business transaction.

'''Holly:''' You fuckin' freaks are not getting away with this!

'''Snow:''' Holly! Don't move!

'''Dee:''' Yeah, listen to your lady, love.

'''Dum:''' Things don't have to turn sloppy, now.

<tabber>Calm down, Holly.=

'''Bigby:''' Calm down, Holly.

'''Bigby:''' Holly, let me handle this.

'''Bigby:''' It's not worth it, Holly. They'll leave on their own.

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Dee:''' Yeah, let's spare all the fuss. It's just a dead whore.

'''Gren:''' I'm gonna kill you!

Holly growls. She and Gren charge at the Tweedles.

'''Snow:''' Holly!

Dee shoots Holly in the chest.

'''Gren:''' Holly!

Gren knocks Dum to the ground, then chokes him. Dee aims his gun at Gren.

'''Dee:''' I got it, Dum!

<tabber>Grab gun=

Bigby charges at Dee.

|-|Do nothing=

'''Dee:''' Gotta make everything a carnival!<br />

Dee shoots Gren in the chest.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Shit!

Bigby grabs Dee's and presses it against his throat. Dee stumbles backward into a stack of pallets.

<tabber>Choke him=

Bigby hits Dee in the face with the gun, then drops it. He raises his fist.

Dum shoots Gren in the chest.

Dum points his gun at Bigby, who charges at him. Dum shoots Bigby in the shoulder.

==Fabletown Business Office==

''Fabletown Business Office''<br />''The Woodland Building''<br />''11:43 PM''

[[Bufkin (Video Game)|Bufkin]] is trying to piece together the shattered mirror while Snow observes. If she was injured during the fight, she has a bandage and stitches on her neck. Bigby leans against the desk, his injury now bandaged. [[Swineheart (Video Game)|Doctor Swineheart]] puts his medical supplies back in his bag.

'''Swineheart:''' I did as well as I could to take out the buckshot, but there's still some shards left embedded in your shoulder. They'll eventually worm their way out on their own, but...until they do, you're gonna be sore.

'''Snow:''' Bigby, Dr. Swineheart was appointed Fabletown physician for a reason.

'''Swineheart:''' It's okay, there's only one thing you have to take away from all this: take it easy.

Bigby stands up, inhaling sharply as he moves his arm.

'''Swineheart:''' Don't go looking for any more fights. Keep strain off your heart. And try and get some rest.

<tabber>I have to find Crane!=

'''Bigby:''' I can't "take it easy". I have to--mph... I have to find Crane.<br />

'''Snow:''' Bigby? What's wrong?<br />

'''Swineheart:''' Lack of sleep, for one thing. Getting shot for another. He'll be fine.

|-|How's everyone else?=

'''Bigby:''' How's everyone else? They all make it?<br />

'''Swineheart:''' They're fine.

|-|Snow, are you okay?=

'''Bigby:''' Are you okay?<br />

'''Snow:''' Yeah, I'm good.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Is she?<br />

'''Swineheart:''' She's fine, Bigby.

{{#tag:tabber|(If Snow was shot)=

'''Swineheart:''' Nothing a little stitching couldn't patch up.

}}

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Swineheart:''' I had everyone that got wounded sent home. Holly refused to let me see where she lived, so I left her and Grendel back at her bar with a dose of juniper and spring water.

{{#tag:tabber|(If Bigby ask how everyone else is doing)=

'''Swineheart:''' They're titans, Bigby. They'll be fine.

}}

'''Swineheart:''' Just remember what I said. The stitches won't hold up if you continue to act...like you normally do. Everything in moderation. And, uh, eat more chicken. Your blood pressure's through the proverbial roof.

<tabber>I'll try.=

'''Bigby:''' I'll try to.<br />

'''Swineheart:''' Alright, then. Very good.

|-|Too bad.=

'''Bigby:''' Taking it easy's not really my thing, doc.<br />

'''Swineheart:''' Well, whatever your "thing" is, try and make it work better for you next time.

|-|It's not up to me.=

'''Bigby:''' Look, I'm not the one who creates the situations. I'm just the one who has to deal with them.<br />

'''Swineheart:''' So you say.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

The phone rings, and Snow picks up.

'''Snow:''' Business Office. I know, I'll have to call you back. ''(hangs up phone)'' The town is starting to find out...

'''Swineheart:''' Well, I've leave you two to it, then. Miss White. Bigby.

The doctor leaves the office.

'''Snow:''' So...to recap...

Bigby steps behind the partition and starts putting on his shirt.

'''Bigby:''' Crane watched me through the Magic Mirror uncover his room at the Open Arms. Then he smashed it so we couldn't use it ourselves to go after him. And we know this because Bufkin was drinking in the rafters. That about cover it?

'''Snow:''' Once he puts all the pieces back together...it'll be easy to catch Crane.

Bigby walks back over to Snow.

'''Snow:''' So...I guess that's the plan. Currently. But I don't know...

<tabber>Just wait for the mirror?=

'''Bigby:''' That's the plan? Just wait for the mirror?<br />

'''Snow:''' It's all we have right now.

|-|Crane's getting away.=

'''Bigby:''' We don't have time to wait for the mirror. Crane could be getting on a train right now.<br />

'''Snow:''' Well, I don't want to just go running off into the night without some direction.

|-|Any other leads?=

'''Bigby:''' There's no other leads? This is it? Just wait for the mirror.<br />

'''Snow:''' Yeah.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' What the hell is going on? Just... I don't know what the Tweedles get out of this. I--I don't know if Crane sent them, I don't know if... I mean, this is gonna sound crazy, but... Do you really think Crane did it? Everything points to him, I get it, but... Do you really think he killed those women? Because it's just... It's incomprehensible to me.

<tabber>He's behind everything.=

'''Bigby:''' He killed them. And he sent Dee and Dum to slow me down.

|-|I think he killed Lily...=

'''Bigby:''' From what I saw at the Open Arms...everything points to Crane murdering Lily. What isn't adding up for me is Faith. Why would he kill her? It doesn't seem connected.<br />

'''Snow:''' Yeah, it doesn't make sense.

|-|I'm not sure.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm as confused as you are, to be honest. I don't know... It just doesn't make sense.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' He's...he was a conniver, a...a coward, a liar. And I'll always hate him for that. And I'll hate him for how he...held me in his thoughts. But murdering prostitutes...

'''Bufkin:''' Ow.

'''Snow:''' Everything okay over there?

'''Bufkin:''' Yes, Miss White! Just cut myself on a piece of the glass. Nothing to worry about!

'''Snow:''' Thanks for tonight, by the way. That could have gone really terribly... I mean, even worse than it did. I'm glad you were there.

<tabber>Any time.=

'''Bigby:''' Any time.

|-|I feel bad for Holly.=

'''Bigby:''' I just feel bad for Holly, really.<br />

'''Snow:''' Yeah... Time heals everything, eventually. At least, I hope so...for her sake.

|-|The Tweedles got away.=

'''Bigby:''' I just can't fucking stand that they got away.<br />

'''Snow:''' We'll catch up to them, Bigby. You did enough.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' Can I, uh, ask you a question? It's kind of personal... And I don't want to offend you. But after tonight... It's on my mind.

<tabber>Sure.=

'''Bigby:''' Sure.

|-|What's on your mind?=

'''Bigby:''' Why? What's on your mind?

|-|Let's keep this professional.=

'''Bigby:''' Snow...let's just, uh, keep this...<br />

'''Snow:''' Oh, okay.<br />

''Snow will remember that.''

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>
<tabber>(Didn't say to keep it professional)=

'''Snow:''' It's just...when stuff hits the fan...like--like it did tonight... It feels like before we came to the city. It feels kind of like home. And I've heard it said...that maybe...in some time, little, bottled-up way, deep inside...you kind of enjoy it...when things go wrong. Because it just gives you an excuse to...just, you know...stop pretending?

{{#tag:tabber|So what if I do.=

'''Bigby:''' So what if I do? You think we're broken or something, is that it?<br />

'''Snow:''' I don't know. Maybe we're just not cut out for this world. We can't eat each other's hearts anymore, Bigby. This can't be like the old days. We have to make it better.

{{!}}-{{!}}Why bring this up?=

'''Bigby:''' Why even bring this up?<br />

'''Snow:''' I guess it doesn't matter.

{{!}}-{{!}}No, I don't enjoy it!=

'''Bigby:''' Fuck no, I don't enjoy it! Are you kidding me? It's horrible what happened tonight, I wish it didn't happen!<br />

'''Bufkin:''' Uh, guys? We have a problem...

'''Snow:''' What is it?

'''Bufkin:''' I can't finish the mirror. It's missing a piece.

'''Snow:''' What do you mean...missing a piece?

'''Bufkin:''' Yes, it's, uh... It's not here.

<tabber>Crane must have taken it.=

'''Bigby:''' Crane must have taken a shard with him.<br />

'''Snow:''' I can't believe this.

|-|Sure it's not here?=

'''Bigby:''' Bufkin, are you positive it's not here? Maybe it just slid under one of these cabinets...<br />

'''Bufkin:''' No, I'm sure it's not here. I checked every corner.

|-|You wasted our time!=

'''Bigby:''' You waste an hour trying to fix this fucking thing and you can't even finish the job?<br />

''Bufkin will remember that.''<br />

'''Bufkin:''' I tried, alright?!<br />

'''Snow:''' It's okay. It's just...maybe it's around here somewhere...<br />

'''Bufkin:''' No, I'm sure it's not here. I checked every corner.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Bufkin:''' I saw Crane pick something up after he smashed it. I'm sorry... I didn't realize what it was until now.

'''Snow:''' The mirror can't work unless it's whole.

'''Bufkin:''' Well, that's not entirely true...

'''Snow:''' Or what, Bufkin? What? We sit around and wait until it mends itself? We have no idea how long that will take. We're just gonna have to do this the hard way.

'''Bufkin:''' I'm just saying, waiting is an option...

'''Snow:''' No. We can't depend on the mirror.

<tabber>What's the "hard way"?=

'''Bigby:''' What exactly is the "hard way"?<br />

'''Snow:''' We'll look through his things, his desk, everything.

|-|I'll find Crane myself.=

'''Bigby:''' Just forget it, I'll find him myself.<br />

'''Snow:''' How? We don't know where he went.

|-|How long will the mirror take?=

'''Bigby:''' Alright, how long will it take for the mirror to reform?<br />

'''Bufkin:''' It could take days...<br />

'''Snow:''' Or months. Or years.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' He had to have left something that tells us where he's going. He's a neat freak but he was never that smart.

'''Bufkin:''' Smart enough to take a piece of the mirror... We can still solve this ourselves... I know that it--

'''Snow:''' Never mind that, come help me look.

'''Talk to Bufkin'''

<tabber>(Said Bufkin wasted their time)=

'''Bufkin:''' Hello, Bigby... I can still, you know, I can still help you with Crane.

'''Bufkin:''' Hi, Mr. Bigby... I can still help you catch Crane, you know...

</tabber>

'''Bigby:''' Oh, yeah?

'''Bufkin:''' Yes! I saw him jump on the telephone before he left. He called up somebody. He said he needed to see "his witch", or that he would need to get to "the witch for that"...whoever that is.

'''Bigby:''' His witch?

'''Bufkin:''' Yes, it sounded like the one he got his "Snow" glamours from.

'''Bigby:''' Mm.

<tabber>Why didn't you stop him?=

'''Bigby:''' Why didn't you try and stop him?<br />

'''Bufkin:''' What do you want me to do, yank on his hair? I'm only three feet tall, there are limits here.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Okay, okay.

|-|See anything else?=

'''Bigby:''' You didn't see anything else, did you?<br />

'''Bufkin:''' No, not, uh, not especially.

|-|It's not your fault.=

'''Bigby:''' Look...the whole mirror thing. It's not your fault, alright?<br />

'''Bufkin:''' You mean it?<br />

'''Bigby:''' Yeah.

'''Bufkin:''' I'll just...see if I can do anything about this.<br />

'''Bigby:''' You do that.

'''Talk to Snow'''

<tabber>(Talked to Bufkin)=

'''Bigby:''' Bufkin says that he overheard Crane call somebody before he left. It sounds like he's going to see a witch, or..."his witch". His glamour witch.

'''Snow:''' Wait, really? None of the 13th Floor witches would allow that sort of thing. They must be somewhere in the city. It's something, at least.

</tabber>

'''Bigby:''' Find anything?

'''Snow:''' No, but there's enough notes and stuff here to take all night. Maybe check that stuff there?

'''Talk to Snow again'''

 Ichabod Crane,<br />

 Are there any updates on the extra

 Dear Mr. Ichabod Crane,<br />

 I am writing to ask, again, that you please

 Pinocchio says his skin is splintering. I don't
 know what that means, but I assume it's some-

 air like we asked you three months ago. At the

Bufkin flies over to the other two.

'''Bufkin:''' Well, yes, it sounded like the one he got his, uh, "you" glamours from. It must be about this ring.<br />

'''Snow:''' Why not mention this before?

}}

|-|(Didn't talk to Bufkin)=

'''Bigby:''' Wait, what? What witch? What meeting?<br />

'''Bufkin:''' He called up somebody. He said he needed to see "his witch", or that he would need to get to "the witch for that"...whoever that is. Well, yes, it sounded like the one he got his, uh, "you" glamours from. I'm sure it's about this ring. They must have it.<br />

'''Snow:''' Why not mention this before?

</tabber>

'''Bufkin:''' No one asked me!

'''Snow:''' Bufkin!

'''Bufkin:''' And I'm hungover, I'm sorry! He set the meeting at 2:00 AM. Tonight.

[[Bluebeard (Video Game)|Bluebeard]] enters the office.

'''Bluebeard:''' What's going on? Is the mirror fixed yet?

'''Snow:''' Bluebeard, this isn't the time.

'''Bluebeard:''' Is the mirror fixed or isn't it? You called me to--

'''Snow:''' I called just to see if you knew where Crane could be, and that was it, okay? And I'm sorry I said anything more than that.

'''Bluebeard:''' Well, you did, and I know. The cat's out of the bag. So...can we find the dull pervert or not?

'''Bufkin:''' I tried to, but...

'''Snow:''' This isn't your concern.

<tabber>Get out, Bluebeard.=

'''Bigby:''' Blubeard, get the hell out of here. This is none of your business.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' None of my business? Crane's the murderer, he escaped, it seems he's foiled your every attempt at locating him, and now it's none of my business?<br />

'''Snow:''' We don't know if he's the murderer.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' Oh, please, of course he is.

|-|The mirror can't be fixed.=

'''Bigby:''' No. It can't be fixed. It's missing a piece.<br />

'''Snow:''' This is none of Bluebeard's business, Bigby.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' None of my business? Crane's the murderer, he escaped, it seems he's foiled your every attempt at locating him, and now it's none of my business?<br />

'''Snow:''' We don't know if he's the murderer.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' Oh, please, of course he is.

|-|Snow shouldn't have called you.=

'''Bigby:''' I don't know why Snow told you anything.<br />

'''Snow:''' He and Crane talk all the time, okay? He was a resource...albeit one that turned out to be useless.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' We hardly talk all the time...besides, why spend time on such guttersnipe?

|-|...=

'''Bluebeard:''' Oh, it isn't?<br />

'''Snow:''' No. And frankly, it's none of your business.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' None of my business? Crane's the murderer, he escaped, it seems he's foiled your every attempt at locating him, and now it's none of my business?<br />

'''Snow:''' We don't know if he's the murderer.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' Oh, please, of course he is.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' Look, this just isn't the time. He took a piece of the mirror, so we can't use it.

'''Bufkin:''' The only thing we know is that Crane's going to see a witch at two o'clock.

Snow and Bigby glare at Bufkin.

'''Bluebeard:''' AM or PM?

'''Bufkin:''' AM.

'''Snow:''' Listen, Bluebeard, you're not a part of this.

'''Bluebeard:''' I don't think you're in any position to turn away help.

'''Snow:''' Define "help".

<tabber>Bluebeard, why do you care?=

'''Bigby:''' Why do you even care about this?<br />

''Bluebeard will remember that.''<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' Why? I'm invested in this enterprise we call Fabletown.<br />

Snow scoffs and rolls her eyes.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' Literally invested, since it's mostly my money that keeps the whole thing running. And tonight I hear that Crane has been killing Fables? And there's no system in place to catch him?

|-|What do you know about Crane?=

'''Bigby:''' What do you know about Crane, anyway?<br />

''Bluebeard noticed that.''<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' That he has the stones to kill prostitutes, like any common, sex-frightened serial killer, and not face a real challenge.

|-|You're not needed here.=

'''Bigby:''' You're not needed here.<br />

'''Snow:''' Just ignore him.<br />

''Bluebeard will remember that.''<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' Ignore me?

|-|...=

''Bluebeard noticed your silence.''<br />

'''Bufkin:''' It's okay, we can all work together...right?

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' Look, we know that Crane is going to see a witch, and it's to acquire a magic ring.

'''Bluebeard:''' What's the ring?

'''Snow:''' We don't know what it does or who it's assigned to since Crane tore its page out of the book.

'''Bluebeard:''' This farce was your ridiculous idea for a plan. I mean, who put you in charge in the first place?

'''Snow:''' Fixing the mirror was the most logical thing!

'''Bluebeard:''' You're a secretary, he's the sheriff and none of you were chosen to run this office. Who elected you to make these decisions?

'''Snow:''' Nobody, but that doesn't--

'''Bluebeard:''' Who elected her to spend my money?

'''Snow:''' Well, I've been doing that unofficially for years now.

'''Bluebeard:''' "Unofficially" is not "officially".

<tabber>I'm heading this investigation.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm heading up the investigation, okay, Bluebeard? That makes this a moot point.<br />

'''Snow:''' And somebody needs to run the Business Office why he does so.

|-|Snow can handle it.=

'''Bigby:''' Snow can obviously handle this, so let's drop it.<br />

''Snow noticed that.''

|-|That's not important now.=

'''Bigby:''' There's much bigger things to be worrying about right now, alright?

|-|...=

'''Snow:''' It'll have to do for now.

</tabber>

'''Bluebeard:''' Well, then...excuse me for having the commonwealth in mind.

'''Snow:''' Alright, let's just look on the bright side. We know Crane is going to see the witch that's been supplying him with black market glamours.

'''Bufkin:''' Thanks to me.

'''Snow:''' And that he'll be there at two. So that gives us... ''(checks watch)'' A few short hours to find out who it is and where they live and get them all at once.

'''Bluebeard:''' And a few shorter hours the more you babble about it.

'''Snow:''' We haven't been the ones "babbling".

<tabber>No problem.=

'''Bigby:''' 2:00 AM. Piece of cake.

|-|We're trusting Bufkin?=

'''Bigby:''' Yeah, and that's if he's even going there. We're trusting a monkey's interpretation of a phone call...<br />

'''Bufkin:''' It's not an "interpretation", it's what he said, alright?<br />

'''Snow:''' Yeah, and it's what we have, so let's go on it, okay?

|-|Tell me where to look.=

'''Bigby:''' Yeah, yeah, just point me in the direction you want me to check first.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' Since Lily used the glamours, she'd have known who the witch was...and I don't think Holly's burned her things yet. It would probably have the address or a phone number or something...

'''Bluebeard:''' And Bigby is free to go there if he likes, but I think the question you should be asking is just what do the two Tweedles know about this?

'''Snow:''' It doesn't matter what they know. After tonight, they'd never go to their office.

'''Bluebeard:''' They're not smart enough to try and go anywhere else--

'''Snow:''' The Trip Trap is the better option to track the witch down. That has to be our focus.

<tabber>Lily's stuff might help us.=

'''Bigby:''' If Holly has Lily's things...that'd probably be the safer bet.<br />

''They will remember that.''

|-|I can always do both.=

'''Bigby:''' Look, chances are I'll have to swing by both anyways so--<br />

''They will remember that.''<br />

'''Snow:''' No, chances are you won't have the time.

|-|The Tweedles' office sounds promising.=

'''Bigby:''' Even if they're not there...the Tweedles' office might have something on Crane or the witch.<br />

''They will remember that.''

|-|...=

''They noticed your silence.''

</tabber>

'''Bluebeard:''' I don't really care what you two do, I'm going to his apartment.

'''Snow:''' What? You can't just go up there.

'''Bluebeard:''' And why the hell not?

'''Snow:''' We already looked for the key, remember? I don't know where it is.

'''Bluebeard:''' Then I'll pick the blasted lock! I've wasted enough time waiting for the mirror to find him. I won't waste any more.

'''Snow:''' You just can't go up there alone, alright?

'''Bluebeard:''' I've no interest in nicking his drapes, my dear, if that's what concerns you.

'''Snow:''' What concerns me is you traipsing through possible evidence.

'''Bluebeard:''' Oh, now it's evidence! Before you had no interest and now it's a crime scene!

<tabber>Fine, go ahead.=

'''Bigby:''' Fine, I don't care, just go ahead.<br />

'''Snow:''' We can't just let Bluebeard run amok in Crane's place.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' Ha!<br />

'''Snow:''' He's after something, I just don't know what it is.

|-|You're not going anywhere.=

'''Bigby:''' Bluebeard, you're not going anywhere.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' Really, now! And what, you're going to stand here and babysit me while the rest of your "leads" evaporate into mist?

|-|Stay out of it.=

'''Bigby:''' Bluebeard, just stay out of it, alright? You'll just mess things up further.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' They can't get any more "messed up".

|-|...=

'''Snow:''' We can't just let Bluebeard run amok in Crane's place.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' Ha!<br />

'''Snow:''' He's after something, I just don't know what it is.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' We have to find the witch, Bluebeard, since that's where he's going.

'''Bluebeard:''' Or the sniveling weasel chickened out, never went anywhere, and is upstairs right now in his pitiful penthouse crafting a fort out of couch cushions! Look, this is how a smart person would do it, so this is how we're going to do it...whenever you go, I'll go to the other.

'''Snow:''' I don't like you going anywhere unsupervised. He's up to something, I don't know what it is, but we don't have the time to really worry about it now. Where ya gonna go, Bigby?

'''Dum:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' So you leave Crane alone, and we'll leave you alone.

'''Crane:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' I'd love to join you, but there's some business I need to attend to...

'''Holly:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' No, no, I'm better off dealin' with things alone. I don't need sympathy and I don't need charity.

<tabber>DEE'S OFFICE=

'''Bigby:''' Dee and Dum must know where he is. I should go to their office first.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' Perfect. And I'll go to Crane's apartment.<br />

'''Snow:''' I'll look up their address.

|-|CRANE'S APARTMENT=

'''Bigby:''' Crane's place is right here. I should check that out first.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' Perfect. And I'll go to those two imbeciles' office.<br />

'''Snow:''' Crane's penthouse number is 1903. Let me know what you find.

|-|HOLLY'S BAR=

'''Bigby:''' The witch's identity must be with Lily's stuff. I should go see Holly first.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' Perfect. And I'll go to Crane's apartment.<br />

'''Snow:''' I'll check in with you later.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' I hope you know what you're doing.

==Ichabod Crane's Apartment==

Bigby exits an elevator and walks into the hallway.

Bigby presses play on the answering machine.<br />

'''Bloody Mary:''' Crane? Look, the Crooked Man isn't happy, ''compadre'', and as much as I like making house calls, I have better ways to use my time.

Bigby looks at a statue of the Headless Horseman.

{{!}}-{{!}}Look at teacher pouch=

'''Bigby:''' ''(bends down)'' This hasn't been used in years.<br />

He pulls out a little book and opens it to a random page. Inside it reads "Merry Christmas, Mr. Crane. Thanks for all your help this year. Sincerely, Jeremy".<br />

'''Bigby:''' I forgot. He used to teach in the old days.<br />

He closes the book and puts it back in the pouch, then stands back up.

{{!}}-{{!}}Look at books=

'''Bigby:''' Math, science, history... ''(spots a book titled "The Joy of Lovemaking")'' If I had to guess... this shit didn't work.

Bigby looks at the desk.

'''Bigby:''' ''(opens a drawer)'' Hmm.

Bigby picks up the envelope and opens it. He pulls out a piece of paper.

'''Bigby:''' Crooked Man. ''(reading letter aloud)'' "This is all I could get. I'm afraid Snow will start to notice. I'll have the rest for you next week. Ichabod Crane." What's going on here?

{{#tag:tabber|[Confiscate money]=

Bigby takes the money and pockets it, then puts the envelope back.

Bigby picks up the note.

'''Bigby:''' ''(reading aloud)'' "My dearest Snow, I know you must be aware of my feelings towards you." ''(skims through)'' "...watching you work..." ''(skims through)'' "If I am unable to control myself, it is because I love you"?!

He sighs and puts the note away. After examining the letter and note, Bigby notices a key underneath the items in the drawer. He takes the key.

'''Bigby:''' Might be useful.

Bigby uses the key on the door and opens it. He catches Jack Horner trying to leave out a window with a duffel bag.

{{#tag:tabber|[Grab him]=

Bigby grabs Jack and pulls him inside.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Jack.

'''Jack:''' Wow, it is just... unbelievable running into you here. I mean, of all the places. ''(Bigby crosses his arms)'' This weather, right? A little damp, I guess. But, you know, some people like that sort of thing. You know, I've always wondered... Do you get that wet dog smell when it rains? Like do you have to wear a poncho?

{{#tag:tabber|Explain. Now.=

'''Bigby:''' Don't play dumb. I'm running very low on patience tonight.

Bigby says nothing.

'''Jack:''' Okay okay okay, I know what it looks like, but before you go jumping to conclusions... Crane pays me to water his plants when he's gone. It's a stipend, but you know I need the work. I wouldn't do it for free, right? You know me... So, anyways, now that I'm done--

'''Bigby:''' I don't see any plants.

Jack realizes his fib failed and tries to rush past Bigby to escape.

'''Bigby:''' Hey!

{{#tag:tabber|Stop Jack=

Bigby grabs Jack and forces him against a wall.<br />

'''Jack:''' Augh! Okay!<br />

Bigby turns him around and presses his arm against his neck.<br />

'''Bigby:''' You "heard"?

Bigby snatches the bag from Jack’s hand.

'''Jack:''' Oh, come on.

Bigby opens the bag and sees a glamour tube, which he picks up.

'''Bigby:''' The white deer.

'''Jack:''' Do you always talk to yourself like that?

Bigby glares at Jack.

'''Jack:''' The white uses the white deer on everything. It’s her symbol, or trademark, I guess. Figured I could sell these at the Lucky Pawn.

'''Bigby:''' The Lucky Pawn?

'''Jack:''' It’s one of the Crooked Man’s places. I work there sometimes... when I need some “stability”. It’s a Pawn Shop, get it...?

Bigby starts smoking a cigarette.<br />

'''Flycatcher:''' Heh. I think I've lost count. But, you know, Crane...uh, let me go...recently.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Oh, yeah?<br />

'''Flycatcher:''' What are you looking for exactly? Maybe I can help.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Anything about Crane...or the witch he was using. Something.

Bigby examines the package for the Crooked Man. He opens the can, which contains a note and a roll of bills.

'''Bigby:''' ''(reading note)'' "I'm sorry, I know I'm late. I'll get it to you soon. Ichabod Crane."

'''Flycatcher:''' Who was he sending money to?

'''Bigby:''' Crooked Man. "Care of the Lucky Pawn"? Do you know what that is?

Bigby puts the money back.

'''Flycatcher:''' Is that what you needed?

'''Bigby:''' I don't think so, but it's interesting. There's more going on here. I still need to find that witch though.

Bigby picks up the container next to the coffee can.

'''Flycatcher:''' Hey... Bigby... Do you think, after all this... Do you think I could come back to the Woodlands? Since Crane let me go... I mean, I can still work here, but...I don't think I want to now. I don't want to work with bad people, you know? You and Snow, you're nice.

{{#tag:tabber|Not my problem.=

'''Bigby:''' That's not really my problem.<br />

''Flycatcher will remember that.''<br />

'''Flycatcher:''' Right... I-- I know. Sorry.

'''Bigby:''' Come by the Business Office. I can't make any promises.<br />

'''Flycatcher:''' Right. Of course.

Bigby opens the container and sees a lock of hair.

'''Bigby:''' It's Snow's hair.

'''Flycatcher:''' Snow White? Why w--

'''Bigby:''' We found her hair like this inside Lily's glamour. ''(reading label)'' Aunty Greenleaf. This must be the witch Crane was using.

'''Flycatcher:''' I guess Dee and Dum were getting the hair for Crane and sending it to her? That's not a pleasant thought.

'''Snow:''' Business Office, this is Snow White.

'''Bigby:''' Hey, Snow.

'''Snow:''' Oh, it's you. Sorry, I've been answering angry phone calls for hours. People want to know where Crane is. How'd it go with the Tweedle Brothers?

'''Bigby:''' No address yet, but I got a name for Crane's witch. Aunty Greenleaf. You heard of her?

'''Snow:''' No... I'll get Bufkin started looking for her record, but it might take some time.

'''Bigby:''' Huh...somebody's gotta know where to find her. And Snow...I found a note with some money attached. Crane has been embezzling from Fabletown.

'''Snow:''' Of course. Because why half-ass being a complete sleazeball. Do you think this is tied to the murders? I mean... I guess it doesn't matter yet. We still have to find him.

{{#tag:tabber|I don't know.=

'''Snow:''' You might want to try Holly's place. See if she hasn't burned Lily's things yet. Or Crane's. You might find something there. Although Bluebeard's been there. I'll leave it up to you, but we don't have much time. Crane is meeting her at two AM.

{{#tag:tabber|I'll go to the Trip Trap.=

'''Bigby:''' Let me know what he comes up with.

Bigby enters a building.<br />

''The Tweedle Brothers' Office''<br />''The Bronx''<br />''12:52 AM''<br />''1 hour and 8 minutes left''<br />

Bigby walks into the Tweedles' office to find Flycatcher sweeping while talking to himself. He has a bruise on his face.<br />

'''Flycatcher:''' Oh, hi Bluebeard. Oh no, I'm sorry big guy, you can't come in! Yeah, yeah, cause the thing is, and I don't know if you'd heard, but I'm a third degree black belt in uh, you know, whatever, so I wouldn't take any chances, hombre. Last guy who messed with me got his marbles kicked right through his abdomen, alright?<br />

'''Bigby:''' ''(clears throat)'' Excuse me.<br />

'''Flycatcher:''' Bluebeard was here. He was looking for something... I don't know what. He said it was an official investigation, but how was I supposed to know if he was telling the truth? When I wouldn't let him in...

'''Bigby:''' Shit.

'''Flycatcher:''' He found what he was looking for, I guess. It's just super annoying... I'd just finished cleaning.

'''Bigby:''' What a fucking asshole!<br />

Flycatcher jumps from your tone of voice.

Bigby crosses his arms.

'''Flycatcher:''' I don't know what he wanted. I didn't see what he did after... ''(rubs his face)'' I'm really sorry, Bigby.

Bigby unfolds his arms. He steps into the office.

'''Flycatcher:''' Was he telling the truth? He said you sent him... but, I dunno, I just thought he was lying. I'm not supposed to just let people in here. But then he got mad, saying... just terrible things. He said he'd make sure I got fired.

Bigby heads to the door. Flycatcher steps out into the hallway.

Bigby walks down the stairs and up to the door. A sign on it says "SORRY WE'RE CLOSED - Due to Bereavement".

'''Gren and Woody's Conversation'''

'''Gren:''' ''(laughs)'' She's asleep, ya fuckin' idiot.

'''Woody:''' She didn't even give me a chance to explain!

'''Gren:''' What's left to explain?

'''Woody:''' Just...y'know, what happened.

'''Gren:''' Why would she want to hear that?

'''Woody:''' Well... Can I--

'''Woody:''' Okay, okay, before you get all huffy, it was Snow who let me go, alright? It just--there wasn't no sense in me stayin' in jail, she...she said so herself.<br />

{{#tag:tabber|Get back to jail.=

'''Gren:''' I want a drink. Anybody else want a drink?

'''Gren:''' You think I give a fuck what that fuckin' guy says? Or what you say?

Gren walks behind the bar.

'''Bigby:''' Really?

'''Woody:''' The doc gave them both Barmecidal ambrosia. For the pain.

'''Gren:''' Look, the deal is...if you resist going to sleep...like I a right now...it gives you a very, very, very nice high.

'''Woody:''' And he said that he shouldn't mix it with alcohol.

Gren pours himself a drink.

'''Gren:''' Yes, he did, he certainly did, but lemme tell you something. I haven't felt this good in a long time, fat boy... And I feel like havin' a drink, okay?

<tabber>No way to wake Holly?=

'''Bigby:''' There's no way to wake her up?<br />

'''Gren:''' Ohhhhhh, no. And anyways, the doctor gave me strict orders to let the fine woman sleep. She's had a "very traumatic experience".

'''Bigby:''' Fellas. I'm here for one thing: to look through Lily's belongings and get out of here. Now--

'''Gren:''' Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, and I wanna help you, okay? And I will...but first indulge me, it'll take two seconds. As a show of good faith...and after, we'll all hunt and peck for Lily's shit or whatever.

'''Woody:''' Gren, Bigby didn't come here to get loaded with you.

'''Gren:''' I don't wanna get loaded with him. It's just a quick slug. Not gonna hurt anybody. And then we'll, you know, help you out with your thing.

'''Gren:''' No, but you knew Holly would flip out, and you knew for a damned good fucking reason.

'''Woody:''' You know what? Fuck this. I don't need this shit.

Woody starts to walk away, bumping Gren with his shoulder.

'''Gren:''' Oh, yeah, that's it, now you're teary-eyed. You were always such a lowlife, I don't know why I never realized it 'til now. What do you think about this fuckin' loser, Sheriff?

'''Woody:''' He can think whatever he wants. I don't give a shit.

'''Gren:''' No, that's okay, 'cause I'll tell you what he thinks! He thinks you have to pay chicks to touch your fat hairy ass, that's what he thinks.

Bigby opens the closet door and sees an opened box inside. It says "Deliver to Aunty Greenleaf" with a return address of The Butcher.

'''Bigby:''' "The Butcher".

'''Snow:''' What's that?

'''Bigby:''' A package having to do with someone called "The Butcher".

'''Bigby:''' I saw one just like it at the Tweedles' office.

'''Rachel:''' Shouldn't say that...

'''Snow:''' Nothing?

'''Bigby:''' I keep getting whiffs of that aftershave of his...

'''Snow:''' I do too.

'''Rachel:''' Can I go to bed now? Please?

Snow starts to walk toward the door, and Rachel follows her. Bigby sees a glamour tube on the workbench Rachel was previously standing in front of.

'''Bigby:''' Is that a glamour tube?

'''Rachel:''' Mommy really doesn't let anyone play with that. Trust me, I've tried.

Bigby picks up the container.

'''Rachel:''' Oh, no, no, no, no, no, please, please, please just put that back exactly where you found it. No one is allowed to play with that.

'''Snow:''' It's alright, honey, Bigby's not going to break it.

'''Rachel:''' No, you don't understand. She will freak out if she discovers I've let people in here and let them touch her stuff, okay? She checks all the time to see if things move. I don't wanna get in trouble. Look, I'm already grounded! Just put it back exactly where it was, please.

<tabber>I'll be careful.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm not gonna break it, I just want to open it.

'''Bigby:''' Snow, c'mon, are you kidding? It's a glamour tube, something's going on here...

Bigby says nothing.

'''Rachel:''' No! Put it down!

Rachel lunges forward, but Snow holds her back.

'''Rachel:''' Pleeeeease! Don't! This isn't what you think! You've gotta believe me, that guy isn't here! I promise!

'''Snow:''' It's going to be okay, Rachel!

'''Rachel:''' Please. I'm begging you. I don't wanna... I don't wanna get in trouble.

Bigby opens the glamour tube, and "Rachel" transforms into her real self.

'''Snow:''' [[Aunty Greenleaf]].

'''Greenleaf:''' It hurts...when you do it that fast. What? Not spritely enough?

<tabber>You think this is a game?!=

'''Bigby:''' You think we have time to waste on this shit? You think this is some kind of game?<br />

'''Greenleaf:''' No. I don't. But congratulations on "winning" it...if that matters to you.

'''Bigby:''' Why "Rachel"? Why the little girl?<br />

'''Greenleaf:''' I don't think that's any of your business, Wolf.<br />

'''Snow:''' Why?<br />

'''Greenleaf:''' You don't know anything, honey.

'''Snow:''' Alright. Start explaining. And from the beginning.

'''Greenleaf:''' I was born in the woods to a jackal and a deer...

'''Snow:''' Not. That.

<tabber>Where's Crane?=

'''Bigby:''' Where's Crane? Speak quickly.<br />

'''Greenleaf:''' I ain't a fortune teller, Wolf. I have no heavenly idea where he went to.

|-|Please, help us catch Crane.=

'''Bigby:''' Please, Greenleaf, just help us catch Crane. That's all we care about.<br />

'''Snow:''' That's not all we care about.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Snow...<br />

'''Greenleaf:''' You were...nicer than I thought you would be...when I was...her. But if I help you... I can promise that help will not go unpunished.

'''Bigby:''' None of this pathetic witchcraft crap is gonna prevent me from prying what I need from your gullet. Now tell me where Crane is!<br />

'''Snow:''' You have to know something.<br />

'''Greenleaf:''' Unless you want a recipe for owl stew... There's nothing I know that would help.

{{#tag:tabber|I said no more bullshit!=

(If Bigby said "No more bullshit.")<br />

'''Bigby:''' Huh, that's funny. I distinctly remember telling you just now to not fucking lie to me! I don't think you get it. I'll gladly illustrate how much trouble you're in if you keep up the babe in the woods routine.<br />

'''Greenleaf:''' I have a lot of bullies in my life, Mr. Wolf. One more won't tip the kettle.

{{!}}-{{!}}You're on thin ice.=

'''Bigby:''' I'd be very, very careful If I were you. You're not as cute as that little girl.<br />

'''Snow:''' Greenleaf.<br />

'''Greenleaf:''' When I was starving and homeless and out on the street nobody gave three sticks of thought about me, and now I'm supposed to care what you want? If I helped you, I'd be strung up on the Statue of Liberty before the morning commute. No thanks.

{{!}}-{{!}}You're an accomplice to murder.=

'''Bigby:''' You're an accomplice to murder, do you realize that?<br />

'''Greenleaf:''' You might wanna check your facts on that. It doesn't matter. I can't help you. I have no interest in being turned into a skink and crushed under boot heels.

{{!}}-{{!}}Why are you protecting Crane?=

'''Bigby:''' Just why in the name of everything holy are you protecting this weasely scumbag? I mean...what on Earth could he have done to deserve this kind of loyalty?<br />

'''Greenleaf:''' Crane could be hollow bones tomorrow...and you wouldn't see me cry a drop. But that doesn't mean I can tell you anything. You have friends. Don't you? Well, I don't want Crane's friends for enemies.

{{#tag:tabber|Please, Greenleaf.=

'''Bigby:''' Please, Greenleaf. Crane is a murderer, and he's escaping.<br />

'''Greenleaf:''' You might wanna check your facts on that. It doesn't matter. I can't help you. I have no interest in being turned into a skink and crushed under boot heels.

'''Bigby:''' We can protect you, okay? Whatever it is you're afraid of...we can make sure that it won't come to pass.

'''Bigby:''' I don't give a shit about our problems, Greenleaf. Just talk. Now.

'''Bigby:''' You should be a lot more afraid of me than whatever horseshit you think will come back to bite you.

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Greenleaf:''' You have no idea what's going on, do you?

'''Snow:''' Okay, you know what I think? I think we've been more than patient with you. This witch has been selling illegal glamours that continue to undermine everything we've built... She's harboring a fugitive that took advantage of it, and now she's resisting every attempt to make things right. I frankly don't give a crap if she's afraid for her life, we can at least make sure she never hurts us again. We're destroying the tree.

'''Greenleaf:''' No! How dare you come in here and threaten to take from me the one thing that... That tree is ancient, it's part of the family, and it's the only thing paying for this shithole apartment! And the Fables who can't afford the glamours from you come to me for help. Without them, where do you think they could go?

'''Snow:''' Don't give me that! You're making money off of other people's misery. Two Fables are dead because of this crap. It's too dangerous leaving this stuff with her.

'''Greenleaf:''' You think I like being the old woman in these stories? The men are heroes, the ladies are whores...and the old hags like me get to watch everyone they love die.

'''Snow:''' We have very different ways of handling our fate.

'''Greenleaf:''' Very different means to handle it too.

'''Snow:''' And I don't use it as an excuse to wreck people's lives!

'''Greenleaf:''' I'm sorry, Sheriff, but please... Don't do this.

<tabber>The tree has to go.=

'''Bigby:''' Greenleaf, Snow's right. The tree has to go.<br />

'''Greenleaf:''' No! Look, look, I'll tell you, I'll tell you... Crane was here, he was here and he left.

|-|Wait. Greenleaf could be useful.=

'''Bigby:''' Isn't there another way? She's a witch, can't she just...work for us? That way she'd be official...<br />

'''Snow:''' You want to reward her for criminal behavior? We can't trust this woman on the Thirteenth floor.<br />

'''Greenleaf:''' It doesn't matter, 'cause I'd never do it. I'm not a house cat and I don't play well with others.<br />

'''Snow:''' Oh, trust me, no one would confuse you for a cuddly animal. Bigby...this is an order. Burn the tree.<br />

'''Greenleaf:''' No! Look, look, I'll tell you, I'll tell you... Crane was here, he was here and he left.

|-|We can't ruin this woman's life.=

'''Bigby:''' Snow, it's too much. We can't ruin this woman's life over this.<br />

'''Snow:''' "Ruin this woman's life"? It's a slap on the wrist compared to what she's done! Bigby...this is an order. Burn the tree.<br />

'''Greenleaf:''' No! Look, look, I'll tell you, I'll tell you... Crane was here, he was here and he left.

|-|...=

'''Greenleaf:''' Look, I'll tell you what's going on, just don't burn my tree. Crane was here, okay, he was here and he left.

</tabber>

'''Greenleaf:''' He went to the Pudding N' Pie to try to use my ring on the girls over there to get information.

'''Snow:''' What does the ring do?

'''Greenleaf:''' He thinks it's the Ring of Dispel...you know, that it will pierce the protection around the girls' speech. He says pulling the truth out of them will prove his innocence. It won't, though...damned thing lost its power decades ago.

<tabber>(Said the tree had to go)=

'''Bigby:''' He's been embezzling from Fabletown... stealing money from the treasury for his own personal bullshit.<br />

'''Crane:''' I was gonna pay all of that back.<br />

'''Snow:''' Good. And that's what we'll book him on.

{{!}}-{{!}}He's a sick pervert!=

'''Bigby:''' He glamoured a prostitute to look like you! He played out his sick fuckin' fantasies over and over!<br />

'''Bigby:''' Everything--everything--points to him. Do I have to go down the laundry list? His room, his girl, all his fuckin' lies...<br />

'''Bigby:''' Snow, I--<br />

'''Snow:''' And no evidence that says anything expect he was in the same room at some point in time. He embezzled millions from Fabletown, Bigby. That's what I have to care about. And that's enough.<br />

'''Crane:''' I was gonna pay all of that back.

{{#tag:tabber|Fine, embezzlement.=

(If he said Crane was a pervert.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' It's still fuckin'...disgusting! I just--I...<br />

'''Snow:''' Look, I know how badly you want this to be over with. I want it to be over with too. And I have more reason than anyone here to hate him. And I do, and I will...forever. But I want him brought in for what he did to this town. And not killed by you for personal preference.

{{!}}-{{!}}It's still evidence!=

(If he said everything points to Crane.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' It's still evidence! He was in the same room as her! Maybe she found out about his embezzling.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Snow, why are you defending him?<br />

'''Snow:''' I'm not. I'm defending the order of things, Sheriff. You can hate him. I do. But I want him brought in for what he did to this town. And not killed by you for personal preference.

'''Bigby:''' This whole thing is bigger than Crane. He wouldn't have the stones to send the Tweedles after me. Somebody else is involved.<br />

'''Snow:''' Ichabod Crane. You are under arrest for the misappropriation of Fabletown funds. You have the right to counsel... The right to depose witnesses. But as of right now, you're coming with us.

'''Bigby:''' And for suspicion of murder.<br />

'''Snow:''' No, Sheriff.

And you won't be in that chair one minute before you have to give up something you care about just so the wheels don't fall off the goddamned wagon. ''(stands up)'' I did the best I could with what I had. And the town took everything it could out of me. If I maybe took a little something back in return... Then so be it. I have no regrets.

<tabber>[Break his nose]=

Bigby grabs Crane and punches him in the nose.<br />

'''Crane:''' Aagh. Oh, god...<br />

'''Bigby:''' If I were you...I'd keep that trap of your shut.<br />

''Snow will remember that.''

|-|We're better than you.=

'''Bigby:''' Yeah, see, the thing of it is... ''(pulls Crane close)'' we're better at this than you are.

'''Bigby:''' Better save your energy, huh? ''(pulls Crane close)'' You're going away for a long time.

|-|...=

'''Snow:''' Except getting caught. Right?

</tabber>

Bigby grabs Crane and spins him around toward the other side of the room, then pushes him forward. Snow, Bigby, and Crane leave the building.

== Alleyway ==

The group steps out of the building and into an alley. Crane stops walking, so Bigby shoves him forward.

'''Crane:''' Ouch, okay! Stupid girls and their preposterous schemes...

'''Snow:''' What are you saying?

Crane says nothing, and the group continues moving. A car pulls to a stop at the end of the alley, then starts driving toward them, forcing them to move backward.

'''Bigby:''' Shit.

The group tries to walk through a different alley, but the same car stops at the end of it, then another car stops by as well. [[Dee]] and [[Dum]] step out of the second car, and [[Bloody Mary]] steps out of the first one.

'''Mary:''' Hi. Whatchya got there? Look, it's recently come under our attention that you're...how shall I put this...attempting to claim what is the personal property of the Crooked Man.

Mary takes out and loads a revolver.

'''Mary:''' He's about yea high, a hundred and twenty odd pounds...pissed his sheets until he was fourteen...sound familiar?

'''Crane:''' I haven't told them anything!

'''Mary:''' Not now, not now, shhh. The grown ups are talking. Guys? Speak English?

<tabber>Who are you?=

'''Bigby:''' Who are you?<br />

'''Mary:''' No, no, no, no, no, that's not how this works. How this works is you are going to walk Crane over here...like a good doggie.

|-|What do you want?=

'''Bigby:''' What do you want?<br />

'''Mary:''' That sack of flour. Crane, dear. It's Crane.

|-|Get out of my way.=

'''Bigby:''' If I were you, I'd get out of the way.<br />

'''Mary:''' No, no, no, no, no, that's not how this works. How this works is you are going to walk Crane over here...like a good doggie.

'''Snow:''' You're interfering with Fabletown business...<br />

'''Mary:''' No, no, no, no, no, that's not how this works. How this works is you are going to walk Crane over here...like a good doggie.

</tabber>

'''Crane:''' It wasn't my fault!

Snow punches Crane in the stomach.

'''Snow:''' Shut. Up. ''(to Mary)'' You're interfering with official Fabletown business. Step aside.

'''Mary:''' Tweedle Dee, what's the, uh, y'know, that thing the mundies call me?

'''Dee:''' Wh--what?

'''Mary:''' My nickname. You know what I'm talking about.

'''Dee:''' Uh... Bloody Ma--

'''Mary:''' Bloody Mary, that's it, thank you. And do you know why they call me that? Because some of them, they think it's funny to have their little sleepovers and go into their little bathrooms and say my name five times in the mirror. They find it less funny when I actually show up and feed their lungs to the family dog. Arf! And I do that for a hobby. Like golf, to relax. This is my job. I like my job. So think about what I'm gonna to do to you, your girl, and the rest of your friends if you don't hand over the sockpuppet now.

<tabber>Crane is in my custody.=

'''Bigby:''' He's in custody, so move your car.

|-|Fuck off.=

'''Bigby:''' You can fuck off if you think you're gettin' him.

|-|Wrong day to pull this.=

'''Bigby:''' This was really the wrong day to try and pull this shit.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Dee:''' I told you he'd never just give him up.

'''Mary:''' Fuck it.

Mary walks away and leans against the car. The Tweedles aim their guns at Bigby. If he dodges, they fire, but he ducks, and the shots hit a trash can instead. The Tweedles shoot him several times in the torso, and he collapses against the wall.

'''Snow:''' Bigby?

Bigby opens his eyes, and stands up, now in his werewolf form. The Tweedles continuously shoot him, but he steadily moves forward. His skin starts to turn gray as he gets closer to his true form. After one of the bullets hits him, he falls to his knees, but stands up again, now covered in gray fur and in the form of a bipedal wolfman.

<tabber>Throw dumpster=

Bigby throws the dumpster at the Tweedles, who jump aside.

|-|Throw electrical box=

Bigby rips the box out of the wall and throws it at the Tweedles, who jump aside.

|-|Do nothing=

Bigby gets shot, but is unfazed.

|-|Attack Dee/Dum=

Bigby charges forward.

</tabber>

Bigby rushes at the Tweedles, and grabs Dum, smashing him against the wall. He can do so several more times, or do nothing. Dee shoots him in the back, making him drop Dum.

<tabber>Attack Dee=

Bigby knocks Dee against the wall, then picks him up.

{{#tag:tabber|Throw him at Mary=

Bigby and throws him at Mary. She moves aside, and Dee hits the car.

{{!}}-{{!}}Throw him into the sign=

Bigby throws Dee into the “Jazz Lounge” sign, smashing him against it and making him fall behind Mary.

}}

|-|Do nothing=

Dee shoots Bigby, but the bullet ricochets and hits him in the face. He grabs his face in pain.

</tabber>

Dum brandishes his gun like a baseball bat. Bigby can take it out of his hands and throw it on the ground, or do nothing and get hit in the face with it. Bigby then grabs Dum and slams hi against the wall.

'''Dum:''' Fuck...you...Wolf...

<tabber>[Kill Dum]=

Bigby rips out Dum's throat, then drops him on the ground.<br />

''Yo killed Tweedle Dum.''

|-|[Let Him Go] / ...=

Bigby releases Dum.<br />

''You let Tweedle Dum live.''

</tabber>

Bigby gets shot in the back by Mary.

'''Bigby:''' Urhg!

Bigby stumbles and collapses on the ground.

'''Snow:''' Oh, God, Bigby!

'''Mary:''' It was a good show, but, you know... It just didn't know when to end.

Mary puts her gun away and opens the car door, taking out the Woodsman's axe. She drags it along the ground and she slowly approaches Bigby. He tries to get up, but fails.

'''Mary:''' You know...you wouldn't think silver bullets would work on anything but a pure werewolf, but...as it turns out...that's just not the case. Right, Wolfy? I mean, hey, look, I know it sounds ridiculous, but...really, guys... Can you argue with these results?

Mary kicks Bigby, turning him onto his back.

'''Mary:''' 'Cause I know I can't.

Mary hovers the axe over his neck, then raises it up, preparing to strike.

'''Snow:''' Wait! Stop! Just...take him, okay? Take Crane. Just stop. Please.

'''Mary:''' Mmmm... Yeah, I don't know.

<tabber>Snow, stay out of it!=

'''Bigby:''' Snow--egghg...stay out of this!

|-|Just get out of here!=

'''Bigby:''' Just--mmph--get out of here!

|-|Don't do this!=

'''Bigby:''' Snow--emmph.. don't do this!

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

The window of the car rolls down, and the passenger gestures to Mary.

'''Mary:''' It's your lucky day, kid. The Crooked Man says it's okay with him.

Snow kneels next to Bigby.

'''Mary:''' Hello, Ichabod. Got a stomachache?

Crane walks over to Mary.

'''Mary:''' Oh, and just between us girls... Crane ain't no killer. ''(grabs Crane's ear)'' I mean, look at his face. Couldn't stick a pig if his life depended.

Crane steps into the car.

<tabber>(Killed Dum)=

'''Mary:''' Nope. Not like your boyfriend here.

|-|(Let Dum go)=

'''Mary:''' Kinda like your boyfriend here. Too pussy to ruin a Tweedle's day.

</tabber>

Mary stomps on Bigby's arm. It breaks, the bone sticking out of his arm. Bigby growls in pain.

'''Mary:''' Well, this is gonna be...a beautiful relationship we have with you guys. Really. I mean it. I'm jazzed about it. Out with the old... In with the new. Long live the Queen. I'm sure we'll be in touch. ''(waves goodbye)'' See ya 'round.

Nerissa peeks out from behind the corner of the back of the alley. Mary gets into the car and drives off.

==Bigby's Apartment==

[[Bigby Wolf (Video Game)|Bigby Wolf]] is sitting on the chair in his living room. He sees a trail of blood on the floor, then looks up to see [[Bloody Mary]] wielding the Woodsman's axe.

'''Mary:''' See you around.

Mary brings the axe down on Bigby. He wakes up from the nightmare, still in his sofa in his apartment. [[Swineheart (Video Game)|Swineheart]] is removing the bullets from his injuries. [[Snow White (Video Game)|Snow White]] is standing nearby.

''Bigby's Apartment''<br />''The Woodland Building''<br />''Early Morning''

'''Swineheart:''' Hollow-point bullets are a nasty business. The silver slug deformed and shredded on impact.

'''Snow:''' He'll be okay, though...

'''Swineheart:''' Mm?

'''Snow:''' He'll be okay?

'''Swineheart:''' His internal organs are positively riddled. If I don't extract every single scrap of silver...he's liable to suffer some long-term toxicosis...

Bigby groans and sits up.

'''Swineheart:''' Easy there. Try not to move.

Bigby coughs and spits up blood.

'''Snow:''' Bigby...

Bigby inhales sharply, looking at the bone protruding from his arm.

'''Swineheart:''' We can't keep meeting this way, old boy... I'd figured I'd be done before you were conscious. But there's little I can do for the pain. Just stay still and let me finish.

<tabber>What happened to me?=

'''Bigby:''' What... what happened to me?<br />

'''Snow:''' There was--<br />

'''Swineheart:''' You got lucky, and found yourself in the care of a most skillful surgeon. Me.

|-|My arm!=

'''Bigby:''' My arm...<br />

'''Swineheart:''' Yes, very ugly. But not life-threatening. I can't say the same for these bullets peppered throughout your vital organs.

|-|Am I going to be ok?=

'''Bigby:''' Swineheart... How bad is it?<br />

'''Swineheart:''' Well, not the worst I've seen, but damn near it. I must say...you're testing even my skills here.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

Swineheart extracts a piece of the silver bullet and drops it into a cup. Bigby lifts his injured arm to examine it.

'''Snow:''' Please, Bigby, don't move it. Doctor...

'''Swineheart:''' Look, I'm a bit engaged saving his life at the moment...but if the fractured extremity concerns him that much, he can set it himself.

<tabber>Set bone=

Bigby starts to move his arm with his other hand, but stops due to the pain. He picks it back up and sets his bone back in place, his eyes briefly turning yellow.<br />

'''Swineheart:''' Hm. Not bad. That'll do, I suppose.

|-|Do nothing=

'''Swineheart:''' For heaven's sake...<br />

Swineheart sets the bone back in place, Bigby's eyes briefly turning yellow.<br />

'''Swineheart:''' See, now? That wasn't so difficult, was it? That'll do. You're probably better off. This way, I won't have to reset it later.

</tabber>

[[Colin (Video Game)|Colin]] walks up to the group.

'''Swineheart:''' He's lucky to be alive. And he won't be next time if he keeps going like this. He didn't listen to me before. Maybe he'll listen to you.

'''Snow:''' I don't know about that...

'''Swineheart:''' Well, he should. There are limits to what even I can do.

<tabber>I can hear you...=

'''Bigby:''' You know... I can hear you...<br />

'''Swineheart:''' Quiet. Just relax.

|-|This is the job.=

'''Bigby:''' This...is the job...

|-|You think I wanted this?=

'''Bigby:''' It's not like I...asked for this shit to happen.<br />

'''Swineheart:''' Yes, but it's not like you actively discouraged it, either.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

Snow leans closer to Bigby with concern.

'''Swineheart:''' Excuse me, Miss White, but...perhaps it'd be better if you gave me a few minutes to finish with him.

'''Snow:''' I--I think I should stay. At least until he's...out of the woods.

'''Swineheart:''' Believe me, he couldn't be in better hands. And I need the space to work, so... If you wouldn't mind... We'd appreciate the headroom.

<tabber>Stick around, alright?=

'''Bigby:''' Stick around, alright? I don't know if I trust this guy...<br />

'''Swineheart:''' Oh, please. I could do this with my optic nerves severed.

|-|I'll be fine.=

'''Bigby:''' Don't worry, Snow. I'll be okay.

|-|Don't look Snow.=

'''Bigby:''' I'd, uh...I'd prefer you don't watch this, anyway.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Swineheart:''' We'll be done in a moment, just please...give us the time.

Snow walks away and sits down at the table in the dining room.

'''Colin:''' Hey, Doc? How much longer?

'''Snow:''' Colin, leave him be.

'''Swineheart:''' It's finished when it's finished.

'''Colin:''' 'Cause I once watched a vet sew a turtle together in ten minutes flat.

'''Snow:''' Colin, you're not even supposed to be here right now.

'''Colin:''' Oh, really? Where am I "supposed" to be? I'm here to take care of my friend.

'''Snow:''' With what? Your hooves?

'''Colin:''' Hey, listen, lady...

'''Swineheart:''' Please keep it down back there, thank you...

<tabber>Don't distract the doctor...=

'''Bigby:''' Could you please not distract the doctor while he has my chest cut open?<br />

'''Swineheart:''' Yes, that would be helpful.

|-|Colin, shut up.=

'''Bigby:''' Colin...shut the hell up, will ya?<br />

'''Swineheart:''' Yes, that would be helpful.

|-|I need quiet!=

'''Bigby:''' Could I get some quiet in here?<br />

'''Swineheart:''' Yes, that would be helpful.<br />

'''Snow:''' Sorry.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

Swineheart extracts the last fragment of the bullet.

'''Swineheart:''' There. All done.

'''Bigby:''' Great.

Swineheart bandages Bigby's wounds.

'''Swineheart:''' This isn't a habit you should keep to, having visits with me. And, well...this time... This time was no joke. Eat as many metal shellings as you see fit, but take just one more silver round near your heart...and the only place I'll be visiting you is the morgue. Miss White. He'll be fine for light duty...IF he can figure out what that means.

Swineheart packs up his medical supplies.

'''Snow:''' He knows what it means. It's just been...an unusual couple of days...

'''Swineheart:''' I know, but please, don't give him the excuse. His body will eventually give out. Take care of him. Please.

'''Snow:''' I will. He'll need rest, I assume.

'''Swineheart:''' Sleep, mostly. Just keep watch... And make sure he doesn't get into further altercations.

<tabber>I don't need a babysitter.=

'''Bigby:''' I don't need a babysitter. I can look after myself.<br />

'''Swineheart:''' Clearly.

|-|She has enough on her plate.=

'''Bigby:''' Snow has enough to deal with, Swineheart. I can take care of myself.<br />

'''Swineheart:''' Clearly.

|-|I'm right here.=

(If Bigby didn't say he could hear them.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' I'm right here, guys, c'mon...

|-|I can STILL hear you.=

(If Bigby said he could hear them previously.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' I can still hear you.

|-|...=

'''Snow:''' I'll try.

</tabber>

'''Swineheart:''' Anyways... "Guard against", as they say. Miss White. Sheriff... Colin.

'''Colin:''' Swiney.

Swineheart leaves the apartment. Bigby enters the kitchen; he takes a bottle out of the fridge and starts drinking from it.

'''Snow:''' So...how do you, um, feel?

'''Colin:''' It's Bigby, Snow... He'll be okay. Hell, I've seen him take worse.

'''Snow:''' Not much worse...

<tabber>As good as it gets.=

'''Bigby:''' About as good as could be expected. I think.<br />

'''Colin:''' So...not well, then.

|-|Like shit.=

'''Bigby:''' How do you think I feel? Like shit.<br />

'''Colin:''' You should see how you look.

|-|Don't worry about me.=

'''Bigby:''' Don't worry about me, alright? I'll be fine.<br />

'''Colin:''' See? Strong as an oak, this guy.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>
<tabber>(Said he was glad Snow wasn't dead in Smoke & Mirrors)=

'''Snow:''' I'm glad you're not dead.

|-|(Said anything else)=

'''Snow:''' You had us... You had us worried there for a while.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' You, uh, you stopped breathing, you know...when you passed out or...or died...I guess.

Snow touches Bigby's bandaged arm.

'''Snow:''' It...um...it kind of scared the hell out of me. I've never seen you like that. And when Swineheart arrived... You know him, he's never worried, and even he thought you were... I don't know, it was just...awful.

<tabber>I don't die easy.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm pretty hard to kill.

|-|I'm here for you.=

'''Bigby:''' Snow... I'd never leave you.

|-|You were really worried?=

'''Bigby:''' You were really worried about me?

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Colin:''' Yeah, you were really fucked up, man. You looked like when you take an action figure and bend its limbs the wrong way...

'''Snow:''' Colin...

Bigby and Snow leave the kitchen.

'''Colin:''' I'm just sayin', I was worried about him, is all. The guy hasn't had a night's rest in days...

'''Snow:''' We'll all get some rest when this whole thing is done.

'''Colin:''' What "whole thing"? What's even happenin' out there? I mean, do you guys have like a plan or somethin'...?

Bigby opens the closet and puts on his shirt and tie.

'''Colin:''' And who should I be asking? Should I be worried about the Crooked Man taking over? Or is Crane still the thing?

<tabber>We need to get Crane.=

'''Bigby:''' Crane is still our focus. I just can't forget everything he's done, I don't care if he has "problems" with the Crooked Man...<br />

'''Snow:''' Ichabod's gone, it's over for him. He's not coming back. It's not about Crane anymore, Bigby.

|-|This is a bigger thing now.=

'''Bigby:''' The Crooked Man, Bloody Mary, the Tweedles... This is bigger than I what I thought it was.<br />

'''Snow:''' Yeah...

|-|Snow can decide what's best.=

'''Bigby:''' Snow's the boss. She'll know what's best for the community.<br />

'''Snow:''' Thanks.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' The Crooked Man came out of the shadows for a reason... For him to attack us so blatantly like that...he either feels invincible or desperate.

'''Colin:''' Well, if those are my two options... I don't think I'd pick desperate.

'''Snow:''' What do you mean?

'''Colin:''' You traded Crane. To save Bigby. I'm just sayin'...that's not exactly somethin' you do when you're playin' with house money.

'''Snow:''' So he called my bluff. It's not like I'm gonna let Bloody Mary just murder--it was a split-second decision and I don't care how it looked. I'd make it again and twice on a Sunday.

'''Colin:''' Alright, I'm not faultin' ya.

<tabber>Thanks for saving me, Snow.=

'''Bigby:''' Yeah, uh... Thanks, Snow. For all that back there.<br />

'''Snow:''' No problem.<br />

'''Colin:''' "Thanks"? You're not pissed that Crane's flown the coop? Or that the Crooked Man thinks he's got Snow under his thumb?<br />

'''Snow:''' We're all mad about it, Colin... But it's not like we had a strong choice in the matter.

{{#tag:tabber|You weren't there!=

'''Bigby:''' You weren't there, Colin, so just drop it.<br />

'''Colin:''' Okay, okay...

{{!}}-{{!}}Snow did what she had to.=

'''Bigby:''' What else could Snow do? If she didn't hand him over, my ass would be down the Witching Well and Crane still would've been taken.<br />

'''Colin:''' Okay, okay, I'll take your word for it.

{{!}}-{{!}}Of course I'm pissed.=

'''Bigby:''' Of course I'm pissed, but what's done is done.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Yeah, about that... It wasn't your fight to surrender.<br />

'''Snow:''' And what the hell does that mean?<br />

'''Bigby:''' It means that I was the one getting shot to shit, so I'm the one that gets to raise the white flag. And only when I want to raise it. Look, Snow, I could've--<br />

''Snow will remember that.''<br />

'''Snow:''' Could have done what? Gotten yourself killed? Let Crane get away anyway? It was the only option.

|-|We looked weak.=

'''Bigby:''' Yeah, about that... Giving up Crane to save my skin really made us look weak...<br />

''Snow will remember that.''<br />

'''Snow:''' THAT made us look weak? Oh, but not Mary shooting you and holding an axe to your big head?<br />

'''Bigby:''' Look, I'm not saying it was a good day, just that we could've done without all the, uh..."bargaining" at the end. The Crooked Man's gonna think--<br />

'''Snow:''' I don't care what he thinks. It was the only option.

|-|...=

'''Snow:''' What?<br />

'''Bigby:''' I didn't say anything.<br />

'''Snow:''' Look, I don't care... It was the only option.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' All I care about right now is...just what does the Crooked Man want out of this? I thought he was just a...loan shark. But clearly, he's operating in other circles. It can't just be about Crane, right? Getting him out of town? Is this all about the murders? Crane can't be useful to him anymore... So what could this have to do with Faith and Lily? How long has this stuff been going on?

<tabber>The victims are my concern.=

'''Bigby:''' This is about those girls. And it'll always be about those girls. Nothing will change that.<br />

'''Snow:''' We'll see...

|-|Crane was used.=

'''Bigby:''' Crane was a puppet, and the Crooked Man worked the strings. This is all about control of Fabletown.<br />

'''Snow:''' But then what do prostitutes have to do with it? Lily...and Faith?<br />

'''Bigby:''' I don't know how it all works out yet, but I know it does...somehow.

|-|They made the wrong enemy.=

'''Bigby:''' You know, I couldn't really give a shit what they want out of this. They just made the wrong fuckin' enemy.<br />

Bigby gasps in pain and grabs his injured side.<br />

'''Snow:''' Remember what Swineheart said, okay?

|-|...=

'''Colin:''' From the looks of things it's been going on for quite a while.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' The Crooked Man...declared war against us last night. At least that's what I thought, when it happened. But now I see this war has been going on for years. We just haven't noticed it, because our way of doing things is broken. We need to do things the right way.

'''Colin:''' What does that mean? The "right way"?

'''Snow:''' What do you think I mean?

'''Colin:''' I don't know, but it suspiciously sounds like "your way". Bigby's the one on the front lines. You can't give him a leash, he doesn't work that way.

'''Snow:''' A little restraint and thought behind things will never hurt anyone, Colin.

<tabber>We're doing our best here.=

'''Bigby:''' Look, I know things haven't gone great recently, but...we're still doing our best.<br />

'''Snow:''' That's not good enough.

|-|What do you mean?=

'''Bigby:''' Yeah, wait, what do you mean? What is this "right way"?<br />

'''Snow:''' We haven't been doing a good job. You and I.

|-|I can only do things MY way.=

'''Bigby:''' I can only do things the way I do 'em.<br />

'''Snow:''' And where has that left us so far?<br />

'''Bigby:''' Excuse me, but it's left us with a name, maybe the name, the Crooked Man.<br />

'''Snow:''' That's not good enough.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' So...starting now...we do everything cut and dried, by the book, straight as an arrow.

'''Colin:''' Pure as driven snow...

'''Snow:''' I'm not saying I'm the arbiter of--

'''Colin:''' Sure you're not.

Bigby takes a seat next to the dining table.

'''Snow:''' This town has enough monsters. What happened last night...what you turned into...it can't happen again.

'''Colin:''' We need monsters to fight monsters.

'''Snow:''' Colin, if I really believed that we needed him to lose his flippin' mind at a moment's notice... Then that would mean I'd lost all faith in our ability to help this town. Just let that side of you be done, okay? Be done and buried and we can all move on.

<tabber>I had no other choice!=

'''Bigby:''' We were under attack, Snow. What did you expect me to do?<br />

'''Snow:''' There are degrees.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Degrees? I only ever do what's necessary.<br />

'''Snow:''' Really?

{{#tag:tabber|(Killed Dum)=

'''Snow:''' Well, if that's the case...please explain to Colin why tearing Dum's throat out was necessary.

{{#tag:tabber|The fight wasn't over!=

'''Bigby:''' You can't let up until the fight is finished. He was... he was still a threat, and that's all there is to it.<br />

'''Snow:''' Sure.

'''Bigby:''' Because I fucking felt like it, okay? I wanted to destroy something. Is that what you want to hear?<br />

''Snow will remember that.''<br />

'''Snow:''' No, Bigby, it isn't.

'''Snow:''' Do you believe him?<br />

'''Colin:''' Yeah. I do.

|-|Easy for you to say.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm sure from your vantage point, it's extraordinarily easy to judge me.<br />

'''Snow:''' Bigby...<br />

'''Bigby:''' But you sit behind a desk...all day...and only tonight did you see what it's like to be pushed into a corner all the time just for doing your job.<br />

''Snow will remember that.''<br />

'''Snow:''' You think I don't know what it's like to have my life in danger? To not be pushed to do things... I know what it's like, and I know what it's like to lie to yourself...to justify what you've done. So don't talk to me like I'm other people.

|-|You're right Snow.=

'''Bigby:''' I'll do better. We'll do better. We have to be better than them, or...what's the point?<br />

''Snow will remember that.''<br />

'''Snow:''' Right, exactly. Thank you. Look, I'm sorry that I have to bring all this up, but...I think it's important.

|-|...=

''Snow noticed that.''

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' Look, Bigby, I care about how this is done just as much as I care about it getting done.

'''Colin:''' So for that you wanna give him a handicap? Like the bad guys will worry if shit gets sloppy? Everybody wants Bigby to smile and shave and take a shower now and then... Hell, I'm practically the president of the "Bigby, Don't Be Such A Dick" Club... But this is the wrong fucking time to put shackles on him.

<tabber>Colin, I can defend myself.=

'''Bigby:''' Relax, Colin. I can speak for myself, okay?

|-|Thanks, Colin.=

'''Bigby:''' Well, at least someone understands. Thanks, Colin.<br />

Colin smiles.

|-|My work isn't sloppy.=

'''Bigby:''' Hold on, who says I'm sloppy? I always do what I do for a reason.<br />

'''Snow:''' And it's all turned out how you planned?

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Colin:''' He'll get the job done. Just let him do it.

'''Snow:''' I'm going to--I'm going to let you "do it", okay? It's just that...now that I'm deputy mayor, I need your respect. And this situation...has to end.

'''Colin:''' What situation?

'''Snow:''' All unglamoured Fables--starting today--have to go and stay at the Farm?

'''Colin:''' Oh, give me a fuckin' break! Are you gonna let her talk to me like that?

'''Snow:''' It's been the rule for a reason, Colin... And Bigby knows it's for the best of the town. It keeps everybody out of trouble.

'''Colin:''' And what if a Mundy does see me, huh? I'm a pig, not a mouse with a hat and a cane! They know what a pig is! It's not the end of the world!

<tabber>Calm down everybody.=

'''Bigby:''' Look, everyone just calm down, alright?<br />

'''Snow:''' I'm perfectly calm.<br />

'''Colin:''' I'm not! Tell me right now: what's it gonna be, Bigby?

|-|Snow's in charge.=

'''Bigby:''' If Snow says that's the way it's gotta be, that's the way it's gotta be.<br />

''Colin will remember that...''<br />

'''Colin:''' What? Are you kiddin' me?<br />

'''Snow:''' If you would simply get a glamour...<br />

'''Colin:''' "Get a glamour"? With what money? You think I can work? I don't even have thumbs.

|-|I'm not enforcing that.=

'''Bigby:''' That's not gonna happen.<br />

''Snow will remember that.''<br />

'''Snow:''' Yes, it will.<br />

'''Bigby:''' It's an impossible rule to enforce, Snow. You really expect to round up every talking cat and raven in town?<br />

'''Snow:''' There's not that many stragglers left...except the one or two you make excuses for.

|-|...=

''Colin will remember that...''<br />

'''Colin:''' Thanks for the support.

</tabber>

The phone rings, and Snow answers it.

'''Snow:''' Wolf's residence.

'''Colin:''' That's rude.

'''Snow:''' Oh, Bufkin, what is it? Okay, I'll let him know. Thanks. ''(hangs up)'' Guess who's waiting in your office right now? ''(Bigby shrugs)'' Nerissa.

'''Bigby:''' Nerissa?

'''Colin:''' That broad from the Pudding N' Pie?

'''Snow:''' Yes. Apparently she told Bufkin that she has something she needs to talk to you about...but that she'll only tell you. And what do you think that could be?

'''Colin:''' Awwww, Bigby's got an admirer. You always do well with the, uh, disenfranchised. Something about your prickly demeanor attracts them like a moth to a flame.

<tabber>Maybe it's about the fight?=

'''Bigby:''' She probably just wants to talk about last night. The whole thing at the Pudding N' Pie.<br />

'''Snow:''' Maybe.

|-|She probably knows something.=

'''Bigby:''' She knows something... She's helped me a little with the case, maybe she has something else.<br />

'''Snow:''' Maybe she does.

|-|No idea.=

'''Bigby:''' I haven't the slightest.<br />

'''Snow:''' Okay.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' I should get back to the Business Office, I've left Bufkin alone for too long taking calls. And I should probably change out of these clothes. Consider the discussion tabled, but not over. Let me know when you're done with Nerissa.

'''Colin:''' Aye aye, Captain.

Snow leaves the apartment.

'''Colin:''' She's a piece of work. Hey, you're not really gonna send me to The Farm, are ya? I mean... She seemed real serious about it. But I can still hang out here... Right?

<tabber>I wouldn't do that to you.=

'''Bigby:''' Look, uh, maybe a few will get sent up, but you're my friend, Colin. I wouldn't do that to you. Don't worry about it.<br />

'''Colin:''' Thanks, Bigby.<br />

''You chose close friendship over the rules.''

|-|Snow will change her mind.=

'''Bigby:''' I don't know... Snow will come around. She's just... The Crane thing hit her hard, and...she doesn't really know who her friends are right now.<br />

'''Colin:''' Oh, okay. I get it.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Don't worry about it.<br />

''Colin will remember that...''<br />

'''Colin:''' Thanks, Bigby.

|-|Sorry. Rules are rules.=

'''Bigby:''' The rules are the rules. I don't get to make 'em, I just enforce 'em.<br />

'''Colin:''' Bull. Shit. You give favors all the time, I know you do.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Yeah, well, I think I ran out.<br />

''You chose to enforce the rules.''

|-|...=

'''Colin:''' After everything we fuckin' been through...you don't have the nerve to give me a straight answer.<br />

''Colin will remember that...''

</tabber>

Bigby leaves the apartment. If Bigby lets Colin stay, he will watch Bigby leave.

==Bigby's Office==

Bigby opens the door to his office, where Nerissa is waiting.

''Bigby's Office''<br />''The Woodland Building''<br />''Morning''

'''Nerissa:''' Hi, Sheriff.

Bigby enters the office and closes the door.

'''Bigby:''' Hi, Nerissa. Have a seat.

Bigby and Nerissa sit down.

'''Nerissa:''' I, um... Are you okay? You didn't look good last night. I wasn't sure you'd be...you know, around...if I came by.

<tabber>Don't worry about me.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

|-|I've been better.=

'''Bigby:''' Let's just say I've been better.

|-|You should see the other guys.=

'''Bigby:''' Don't be fooled by...this... I didn't get the worst of it.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

Bigby coughs. He puts a cigarette in his mouth, then offers the pack to Nerissa.

'''Nerissa:''' Huff 'n' Puffs? Not many people smoke those.

Nerissa takes out a cigarette from her own pack, and Bigby lights both of theirs.

'''Nerissa:''' Thanks.

<tabber>What did Crane want with you?=

'''Bigby:''' So what was that back there with Crane? He wanted you to tell me something. You know, it's not too late to talk.

|-|Let's hear it.=

'''Bigby:''' You can start talking.

|-|So what brings you here?=

'''Bigby:''' So what is it you wanted to talk to me about? I know what you did for me, sending me to the Open Arms. And I think you want to help me again.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Nerissa:''' There's not a lot that I can talk about. You know that.

'''Bigby:''' So that spell Crane was trying to break... It's not just while you're at work, huh?

'''Nerissa:''' What I mean is... I don't want to waste your time. But I don't want you wasting your own time, either.

'''Bigby:''' Back at the dressing room--at the Pudding 'n Pie--I told you what I was looking for. And you found a way to tell me. You sent me to the Open Arms. Maybe that will work again?

'''Nerissa:''' You can try. I just... Go ahead. It...might work.

<tabber>You have more on Crane?=

'''Bigby:''' Is there more to this business with Crane? You gave me the key to room 204. You put me on to Crane. Is there something I'm missing here?<br />

'''Nerissa:''' These lips are sealed. If I could answer you just like that... I wouldn't have had to make this appointment with you.<br />

'''Bigby:''' No, I guess not.

|-|Is this about the Crooked Man?=

'''Bigby:''' You're here because the Crooked Man just sent Crane to the bottom of my list of worries. And you have something you want to say about that, right?<br />

'''Nerissa:''' These lips are sealed. If I could answer you just like that... I wouldn't have had to make this appointment with you.<br />

'''Bigby:''' No, I guess not.

|-|Was Crane set up?=

'''Bigby:''' Crane wasn't the murderer. The Open Arms was a setup. And you sent me there. Was there someone else you wanted me to find there?<br />

'''Nerissa:''' These lips are sealed. If I could answer you just like that... I wouldn't have had to make this appointment with you.<br />

'''Bigby:''' No, I guess not.

|-|...=

'''Nerissa:''' This isn't gonna work if you don't ask anything. Then again, who knows if it'll work anyway...

</tabber>

'''Nerissa:''' Sometimes...we have to find our way through life on our own. Grasping and fumbling in the dark. I...I used to have friends. To help me find my way. But now...they're gone. And I don't know what to do. Is this making any sense? I'm not sure how I can--

<tabber>Is this about Faith and Lily?=

'''Bigby:''' Are you trying to say something about Faith and Lily?

|-|You can trust me.=

'''Bigby:''' Are you saying you need a friend right now? You can trust me.

|-|Where's this going?=

'''Bigby:''' I'm sorry, but...is this going somewhere?

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>
<tabber>(Didn't ask where it was going)=

'''Nerissa:''' What I'm saying is friends matter. And I...I don't have any left. So I hope you're looking after yours. Are you? Look around you.

{{#tag:tabber|I look out for everyone.=

'''Bigby:''' It's my job to look out for people. And not just my friends.

{{!}}-{{!}}Should I suspect my friends?=

'''Bigby:''' Are you telling me my friends are involved?

{{!}}-{{!}}Are my friends in danger?=

'''Bigby:''' Who are you talking about? Are my friends in danger?

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Nerissa:''' I'm sorry. I thought I could do this. I need you to know... I want to help, but... But...

<tabber>Take your time.=

'''Bigby:''' It's okay. Take your time.

|-|Your lips are sealed.=

'''Bigby:''' But your lips are sealed.

|-|Can't you just talk?=

'''Bigby:''' Come on. Just talk...

|-|...=

''Nerissa noticed that.''

</tabber>

'''Nerissa:''' I'm...sorry if I'm wasting your time. I thought I knew how to say it...

'''Bigby:''' Ribbons... Faith wore one, too.

'''Nerissa:''' Do you like it? Hm? Do you?

<tabber>It's a tool of control.=

(If Bigby didn't say Faith's ribbon was beautiful.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' How can I? It's a tool to keep you stuck in that life. Subservient...<br />

''Nerissa will remember that.''

|-|It's beautiful.=

(If Bigby said the same thing to Faith.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' It was... It is beautiful.

|-|It's not about how it looks.=

'''Bigby:''' It's not how it looks that concerns me. It's what it does.

|-|I'm trying to help you.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm trying to help. I just don't know what I can do...

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Bigby:''' That's why you can't tell me anything... It's the ribbon, isn't it?

Bigby puts out his cigarette and walks up to Nerissa.

<tabber>Can't we just... take the ribbon off?=

'''Bigby:''' Can't we just...take the ribbon off?<br />

Bigby reaches toward the ribbon, but Nerissa jumps back, knocking over the chair.<br />

'''Nerissa:''' No! These lips are sealed!<br />

'''Bigby:''' What?<br />

'''Nerissa:''' You can't--just stay back! You can't do that.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Slow down. It's alright. I'm not gonna do anything.<br />

'''Nerissa:''' Please...don't...<br />

''Nerissa will remember that.''<br />

Bigby sets Nerissa's chair upright and she sits back down.

|-|Any way to break the spell?=

'''Bigby:''' That spell Crane talked about... Is there any way to break it? Is there something I can do about it?<br />

Bigby reaches toward the ribbon, but Nerissa jumps back, knocking over the chair.<br />

'''Nerissa:''' No! These lips are sealed!<br />

'''Bigby:''' What?<br />

'''Nerissa:''' You can't--just stay back! You can't do that.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Slow down. It's alright. I'm not gonna do anything.<br />

'''Nerissa:''' Please...don't...<br />

''Nerissa will remember that.''<br />

Bigby sets Nerissa's chair upright and she sits back down.

|-|[Remove Ribbon]=

'''Bigby:''' You mind if I just...<br />

Bigby reaches toward the ribbon, but Nerissa jumps back, knocking over the chair.<br />

'''Nerissa:''' No! These lips are sealed!<br />

'''Bigby:''' What?<br />

'''Nerissa:''' You can't--just stay back! You can't do that.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Slow down. It's alright. I'm not gonna do anything.<br />

'''Nerissa:''' Please...don't...<br />

''Nerissa will remember that.''<br />

Bigby sets Nerissa's chair upright and she sits back down.

'''Nerissa:''' If you're thinking what I think you are...

</tabber>

'''Bigby:''' Okay. I get it...

Bigby sits down.

<tabber>(Didn't remain silent)=

'''Bigby:''' So the ribbons...if you take them off....

</tabber>
<tabber>I'll fix this.=

'''Bigby:''' I don't know how, but I'm going to fix this. If you could just point me in the right direction, I swear, I will fix this.<br />

Nerissa holds Bigby's hand.<br />

''Nerissa will remember that.''

|-|I'm sorry.=

'''Bigby:''' Sorry. I...wish I could do something.<br />

Nerissa holds Bigby's hand.<br />

''Nerissa will remember that.''

|-|[Comfort her]=

Bigby puts his hand on Nerissa's shoulder.<br />

''Nerissa will remember that...''

Nerissa holds Bigby's hand.

</tabber>

There is a knock at the door, and Nerissa jumps up.

'''Nerissa:''' If anyone finds out I came here...

'''Bigby:''' That's probably Snow.

As Bigby walks past Nerissa, she grabs his wrist, stopping him.

'''Nerissa:''' Listen... Sheriff... Can you keep this conversation between us? I could be in a lot of...trouble. I shouldn't be talking to you. Please.

<tabber>What are you afraid of?=

'''Bigby:''' What are you worried about?<br />

'''Nerissa:''' Just...please don't say anything.

|-|Sure thing.=

'''Bigby:''' I won't tell anyone, don't worry.<br />

'''Nerissa:''' Thank you.

|-|I have to tell Snow.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm gonna have to tell Snow. She has to know about the ribbons...<br />

'''Nerissa:''' If you have to. Just...don't tell anyone else.

|-|...=

'''Nerissa:''' Just...please don't say anything.

</tabber>

Snow opens the door. Nerissa lets go of Bigby and sits back down.

'''Snow:''' Sorry, I just need to talk to the sheriff for a moment. Please excuse us.

'''Bigby:''' One minute.

'''Snow:''' I might have a new lead for you, but I don't know how solid it is. Beauty and Beast called the office just now. They said they wanted to talk to you about something. I wonder if they've heard about Crane...

'''Nerissa:''' Thank you for listening, Sheriff. You should go on to your next business. I don't think you'll be wasting your time.

Nerissa steps out of the office.

'''Snow:''' Uh, wait, you don't have to go...

Nerissa walks away.

'''Snow:''' That was...abrupt.

'''Bigby:''' It's...one way to send a message.

'''Snow:''' What did she tell you? I didn't mean to rush her out. Did you get anything from her?

Bigby takes a pack of cigarettes out of his desk.

<tabber>She told me enough.=

'''Bigby:''' She told me enough. I think she told both of us with the way she just left.<br />

'''Snow:''' Okay, then. Good work.

|-|Look, I took care of it.=

'''Bigby:''' Don't worry. I handled it. She couldn't talk because of the magic. But we managed to understand each other. I did my job. My way. What did you expect?<br />

'''Snow:''' Do you really want to know? Because you have given me reason to doubt you. Surely, even you can see that. And the past few days have been...trying.

{{#tag:tabber|Trust me, Snow.=

'''Bigby:''' You have to trust me, Snow. And I'm pretty sure she left convinced we're on the right track.<br />

'''Snow:''' Okay, then. Good work.

{{!}}-{{!}}You see any blood?=

'''Bigby:''' You didn't see any blood, did you?<br />

'''Snow:''' Bigby, that's not what I--<br />

'''Bigby:''' I was perfectly fucking professional, and she and I had as good a conversation as we could, given the circumstances. And I'm pretty sure she left convinced we're on the right track.<br />

'''Snow:''' Okay, then. Good work.

'''Snow:''' Okay, then. Good work.

Bigby says nothing.

|-|Magic keeps her from talking.=

'''Bigby:''' She couldn't really say anything. The magic that Crane was talking about... It's in the ribbon.<br />

'''Snow:''' And you can't take the ribbon off. Or...?<br />

'''Bigby:''' It's how Faith and Lily died.<br />

Bigby mimics being decapitated.<br />

'''Snow:''' Okay, then. Good work.

|-|...=

'''Snow:''' Okay, then. Good work.

</tabber>

Bigby lights his cigarette.

'''Snow:''' So, about Beauty and Beast. Do you think there's something to it? Is this the right place to look? What could they know about the Crooked Man? Or do you think they just heard about last night... And they're scared about what's been going on?

<tabber>They called for a reason.=

'''Bigby:''' Well, whatever it is, I'm sure they called for a reason. Suppose I better go check it out.<br />

Bigby and Snow leave the office.<br />

'''Snow:''' Hm... You know, Beauty came to me a while back... She was looking for...financial assistance. I told her there was nothing I could do, and...and she said that meant she'd have to go somewhere else. Bigby, you don't think she meant that she was going to go to the Crooked Man, do you?<br />

'''Bigby:''' That would explain why they called.

|-|Nerissa pointed us out there.=

'''Bigby:''' That's what Nerissa was doing. Telling us to go there. I think she made it as clear as she could have.<br />

Bigby and Snow leave the office.<br />

'''Snow:''' Hm... You know, Beauty came to me a while back... She was looking for...financial assistance. I told her there was nothing I could do, and...and she said that meant she'd have to go somewhere else. Bigby, you don't think she meant that she was going to go to the Crooked Man, do you?<br />

'''Bigby:''' That would explain why they called.

|-|Beauty got a loan from him.=

(If Bigby went after Dee.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' Beauty told me she had to take out a loan from the Crooked Man. Seems like a pretty bad deal.<br />

'''Snow:''' I can only imagine what they're thinking now.

|-|It's worth looking into.=

(If Bigby went after the Woodsman.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' Even if there isn't much to it, it's still our best lead. It's worth looking into.<br />

Bigby and Snow leave the office.<br />

'''Snow:''' Hm... You know, Beauty came to me a while back... She was looking for...financial assistance. I told her there was nothing I could do, and...and she said that meant she'd have to go somewhere else. Bigby, you don't think she meant that she was going to go to the Crooked Man, do you?<br />

'''Snow:''' Well, I guess it's the best we've got.<br />

Bigby and Snow leave the office.<br />

'''Snow:''' Hm... You know, Beauty came to me a while back... She was looking for...financial assistance. I told her there was nothing I could do, and...and she said that meant she'd have to go somewhere else. Bigby, you don't think she meant that she was going to go to the Crooked Man, do you?<br />

'''Bigby:''' That would explain why they called.

</tabber>

Bigby and Snow arrive at the elevator, and Snow presses the button.

'''Snow:''' We need to solve this before something else happens. Who knows what...

The elevator arrives, and Bigby steps inside.

'''Snow:''' I have...other matters to attend to.

Bigby leaves the elevator.

'''Beauty and Beast's Conversation'''

'''Beast:''' And you didn't want to tell me what you were into, either.

'''Beauty:''' With good reason. Look what happened.

'''Beast:''' So that's back on me now? I thought we agreed that was settled.

'''Beauty:''' You said it was settled. That doesn't mean I have to agree to it.

'''Beast:''' And when were you going to tell me? Or were you going to keep that a secret too?

'''Beauty:''' You know what it was. You know what was going on, Beast. I had to get a job, and you wouldn't have it. Don't make it into something it wasn't.

'''Beast:''' It's the principle of it.

'''Beauty:''' Don't act like you weren't keeping secrets too.

'''Beast:''' If you're going to bring up ancient history, I don't have to stand here and listen to it.

'''Beauty:''' Fine, go off in a huff. I'm--I'm through talking anyway.

'''Beast:''' Well, I didn't call. Must have been Beauty. She's been...surprising me a lot lately.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Can I--<br />

'''Beast:''' So have you, Bigby. Yet, with all the sneaking around and secrets, somehow, I'm still the bad guy in this. I've had to hear about it all night long from her.<br />

'''Beauty:''' ''(from inside the apartment)'' Who is it? Who's there? Beast? Who's at the door?

|-|(Told Beast)=

'''Beauty:''' If someone called, it must have been Beast. I certainly didn't.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Okay, I--<br />

'''Beauty:''' You know, if you had just kept your mouth shut about me, Beast wouldn't have lost his head over at the Open Arms. He never would have even found the place. And I wouldn't have had to spend the night defending myself for "keeping secrets" with Bigby Wolf. I lost my job because of you. I needed that.<br />

'''Beauty:''' Well, I trust him.<br />

'''Beast:''' Of course you do. He was keeping secrets for you.<br />

'''Beauty:''' It was one little thing. Do you wanna keep fighting about that? Or do you wanna try to sort this out?<br />

'''Beast:''' All I'm saying is we can handle this on our own. You didn't have to bring him here.<br />

'''Beauty:''' We're out of money. And answers. That's why I called. We'll finish this later. But we need to talk to Bigby.<br />

'''Beast:''' Fine. If you wanna talk, we'll talk.

'''Beauty:''' But I...I just don't think he is going to improve our situation.<br />

'''Beast:''' Well, that's what we're going to find out.<br />

'''Beauty:''' I know you're going to disagree, but if he can't keep a little secret, how can we trust him with...this?<br />

'''Beast:''' I trust him.<br />

'''Beauty:''' Well, of course you do. Whatever. It's not just that. Trouble follows him around.<br />

'''Beauty:''' We're just looking for a little peace of mind in this.

'''Beauty:''' Just answer me this first... What if we did have some information on the Crooked Man? If we talk...we're putting ourselves at risk. Could you protect us? I've seen what happens when you cross him... Can you...<br />

'''Bigby:''' All I care about is how can I find the Crooked Man? Who do I talk to? Where do I go?

Beauty and Beast hug each other.

'''Beauty:''' The Lucky Pawn. That's where I borrowed the money. The Crooked Man's behind that place. I'd overheard people talking to Jersey about loans before. So...when I needed money... That's where I went. I didn't know what to do.

'''Beast:''' You could have told me.

'''Beauty:''' You had enough on your plate.

<tabber>Have you seen the Crooked Man?=

'''Bigby:''' Did you ever see the Crooked Man there? When you got your loan...or just shopping?<br />

'''Beauty:''' No, never. But...come on...it's his place. And the Jersey Devil never lets you forget it.

|-|Wait, who's Jersey?=

'''Bigby:''' Wait, who do you deal with?<br />

'''Beauty:''' Jersey. You know, the Jersey Devil.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Oh, yeah... That slimy prick... I didn't realize he was back on this side of the river.<br />

'''Beauty:''' And those Tweedles were always going in and out, probably dropping off a loan payment they squeezed out of some poor Fable. But never the Crooked Man. Mainly it's just regular Fables.

|-|What's really going on there?=

'''Bigby:''' Who gets loans at a pawn shop anyway? What's really going on at this place.<br />

'''Beauty:''' The Crooked Man knows what people need to get by. So...he provides. Besides, it didn't seem like such a bad deal when Jersey Devil was explaining it.

|-|...=

'''Beauty:''' Besides, it didn't seem like such a bad deal when Jersey Devil was explaining it.

'''Beauty:''' I can see now that it was a mistake, but... I'm not the only one who goes there, y'know. I saw the Woodsman's axe there just the other day. It was in a display case.

'''Beast:''' I guess he's hit hard times, too. There's a lot of that going around. I can't imagine he has a lot of "marketable skills".

'''Beauty:''' Sometimes... Fables just don't have anywhere else to go.

<tabber>Mary got the axe from there.=

'''Bigby:''' Fucking Bloody Mary must go through there. She had Woody's axe last night. Tried to chop my damn head off with it!

|-|I only care about my investigation.=

'''Bigby:''' Look, you don't have to explain yourself to me. But I'm not going there for a shopping trip. This is murder and kidnapping we're talking about. And if the axe was there...so were the people behind all this. Anything else is just...background noise.

|-|Why would you ever go there?=

'''Bigby:''' What the hell are you doing hanging out at a place like the Lucky Pawn, anyway?<br />

'''Beauty:''' Sometimes Fables sell things they brought from the Homelands. Things you can't find anywhere else.<br />

'''Bigby:''' You do know there's a difference between pawning something and selling it, don't you?<br />

'''Beauty:''' I...I know that.<br />

'''Bigby:''' You're buying a piece of someone else's misery...with money you don't have.<br />

'''Beauty:''' Well, that's over now...

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Beauty:''' Maybe if you go there you can...sort some things out.

'''Bigby:''' I guess I'll go check out the Lucky Pawn. If I can't track down the Crooked Man there, maybe I can make enough noise that the Crooked Man will come find me.

'''Beast:''' Hold on, Bigby, don't go there. Sounds like you're just going to get Beauty in trouble. And...

Beauty and Beast sit down on the couch.

'''Beast:''' You know that butcher shop? The Cut Above? It's the place on Tubman Street. Same block as the baker and the candlestick maker. Well, I've been delivering packages from there for a while. The thing is...it's for the Crooked Man. And...I don't think it's meat in the packages. You gotta understand, I needed work.

'''Beauty:''' You have to believe us. We didn't think it would get like this.

'''Beast:''' We're decent people, Bigby.

<tabber>What are you delivering.=

'''Bigby:''' Well, what are you delivering? What's going on there? How does this fit into the Crooked Man's operation?<br />

'''Beast:''' I couldn't tell you. But I do know this...it's the only meat market in town that doesn't carry filet. I'm not sure how much actual butchery goes on there.

|-|Did you deliver to the Crooked Man?=

'''Bigby:''' Listen to me very carefully. Did you ever deliver to the Crooked Man? Can you give me an address?<br />

'''Beast:''' No. I delivered to places all over town. But never to the man himself. It never seems to be heading to the same place. But it always comes out of the butcher shop.

|-|You needed THIS work?=

'''Bigby:''' You're telling me that with a place like this, you're so hard up that you need to work for the Crooked Man? The guy you're so afraid of? Bullshit.<br />

''Beast will remember that.''<br />

'''Beast:''' It's not like he runs the counter and hands me the boxes. I never met the guy.

'''Beast:''' Johann, the butcher, called. He had a problem with the refrigeration unit one night. But when I finished, it was your pal, Mary, who showed up to pay me. She said I was reliable, she liked that, and... It's the only thing I've been able to pick up. And it's still not enough. I don't want Beauty to have to work. Especially not where she was. It's up to me to take care of her.

<tabber>You do their dirty work.=

'''Bigby:''' So you do their dirty work, and look the other way?<br />

'''Beast:''' Work is work. All I do is deliver stuff.

|-|Is Mary always there?=

'''Bigby:''' It's Mary you deal with? Bloody Mary is there?<br />

'''Beast:''' No, Johann is the one who hands over the packages. You know, day to day. But I've seen her around there. She, uh...gets under my skin, you know? I...I try to avoid her... But I don't need to tell you what she's like.<br />

'''Bigby:''' You're damn right you don't. I don't need a rundown on her reputation. If Mary works outta there, I need to look into it...

|-|Want my help? Then quit.=

'''Bigby:''' Well, you're done working there. If you want my help, this is over.<br />

'''Beast:''' Yeah, of course. Of--of course.

Beauty holds Beast's hand.

'''Beast:''' I just wanted to provide for Beauty. Give her the kind of life she deserves.

Beauty and Beast stand up.

'''Beauty:''' We shouldn't have to live like this. Scraping to get by.

'''Beast:''' None of us should. We were royalty once. We were accustomed to a certain lifestyle. All we want is to make this place feel a little bit like home. You wouldn't understand, Bigby.

<tabber>Probably not.=

'''Bigby:''' No, probably not.

|-|Fuck. Off.=

'''Bigby:''' Fuck. Off. There are a lot of Fables who have it a lot worse off than you. Or me, for that matter.

|-|I don't need to.=

'''Bigby:''' I don't need to understand. It's not my fucking job to understand. My job is to keep Fabletown safe.

|-|...=

'''Beauty:''' Bigby...

</tabber>

'''Beast:''' So...where are you going? If this all goes sideways, I'd like to know where it's coming from.

'''Beauty:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' The Lucky Pawn. That's where I borrowed the money. The Crooked Man's behind that place.

'''Beast:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' You know that butcher shop? The Cut Above? The thing is... I don't think it's meat in the packages.

<tabber>LUCKY PAWN=

'''Bigby:''' I'm going to the Lucky Pawn. There's too much going on there to ignore. I'll have a word or two with Jersey.<br />

'''Beast:''' You know, Bigby, once you show your face there, word is going to get out. There may be nothing left to see if you go to the butcher shop after.

|-|BUTCHER SHOP=

'''Bigby:''' I want to know what the Crooked Man is hiding at that butcher shop.<br />

'''Beauty:''' You know, Bigby, once you show up there, word is gonna spread. There may be nothing left for you to see if you go to the Lucky Pawn after.

</tabber>

'''Bigby:''' Well, I guess I'll find out.

Bigby leaves the apartment and starts walking down the hall.

'''Beast:''' Wait... I don't know what you're planning to do when you find the Crooked Man, but is there any way you could...help us out?

'''Bigby:''' What do you mean?

'''Beast:''' Well, maybe you can make this all just...go away.

'''Beauty:''' We would really appreciate it. What do you say?

'''Beast:''' Can you help us out?

<tabber>You want me to kill him?=

'''Bigby:''' You're asking me to kill him, aren't you? Is that what you think I do?<br />

''They will remember that.''<br />

'''Beauty:''' No! Of course not.<br />

'''Beast:''' I don't know how you'd get that idea. We just...we know that the Crooked Man is dangerous. To all of Fabletown.<br />

'''Bigby:''' I'm gonna do my job. Lucky for you, that might just solve your problems anyway.<br />

'''Beauty:''' Oh, thank you, Bigby.<br />

'''Beast:''' I'm sure you'll do the right thing.

|-|I'll handle it.=

'''Bigby:''' I'll handle it. I'm not gonna let that crooked bastard ruin any more lives.<br />

''They will remember that.''<br />

'''Beauty:''' Oh, thank you, Bigby.<br />

'''Beast:''' I'm sure you'll do the right thing.

|-|I don't fix debts.=

'''Bigby:''' I don't go around fixing debts. Lucky for you, what I am going to do might just fix it anyway.<br />

''They will remember that.''<br />

'''Beauty:''' Just keep us in mind. Please?<br />

'''Beast:''' I'm sure you'll do the right thing.

'''Johann:''' No, Crane! He said he knows where everybody is. I don't know how, but he's got some way... That's right, it was that creepy Magic Mirror! With the big green head, and all... Why don't you just use that? Find the Crooked Man that way...and leave me alone. Yeah, with stuff like that mirror, I'm surprised that you ever need to leave the office.

Jersey removes his glamour and growls. Woody charges at him but gets knocked the floor. Jersey repeatedly slashes at his face.

'''Bigby:''' Fucker!

Bigby ducks as Jersey tries to bite him, then grabs Jersey's neck. He struggles to hold him back as Jersey continues to snap at him with his teeth.

'''Woody:''' Hey, assholes. I found her.

The Woodsman buries his axe in Jersey's head. He screams in pain and knocks Woody to the ground, then starts trying to remove the axe. Bigby picks up the statue or the anvil and hits Jersey with it, getting splattered with his blood. Bigby tosses the item aside and transforms back into his human self. Woody takes his axe out of Jersey's head, then hovers it over his neck.

==Fabletown Business Office==

''Fabletown Business Office''<br />''The Woodland Building''<br />''Evening''

Bigby enters the office, where Snow, Toad, Bluebeard, and Bufkin are gathered.

'''Bluebeard:''' I don't care who killed the prostitutes, if Crane was helping himself to the community coffers, it means his hand was in my pocket. And you just let him go!

'''Snow:''' I don't know what you heard, but it didn't happen like that.

'''Bluebeard:''' Are you denying the facts?

'''Toad:''' She's denying me the chance to get a word in. Now, Miss White, I--

'''Bufkin:''' Sheriff Bigby has returned!

'''Toad:''' Ah, there's the ole wrecking ball, himself!

'''Snow:''' Bigby, where have you been?

'''Bluebeard:''' I'm not finished here, Miss White--

'''Snow:''' You will have to wait! Just one moment, please.

'''Bigby:''' Look what I found.

Bigby takes out the mirror shard.

'''Bluebeard:''' Seems your dog wants a biscuit.

'''Bigby:''' I'm not in the mood. And you've got a lot to answer for.

'''Bluebeard:''' Oh, really?

'''Snow:''' Bufkin! Get this piece in the mirror, right away!

'''Bufkin:''' With pleasure, Ms. White!

Bufkin takes the piece from Bigby and flies over to the mirror.

'''Snow:''' Finally. Things are swinging back in the right direction. Good work, Bigby. You've been gone all day. What did you uncover? I thought you were going to report back to me. I mean, it's fine... So what else did you find out?

<tabber>Crane used the mirror to find him.=

'''Bigby:''' Once the mirror's fixed, we can use it to find that crooked bastard. Or at least wherever he hangs his hat. That's how Crane kept tabs on him...and everybody else. I'd say he was abusing the privilege. He was probably spying on all of us.<br />

'''Snow:''' He was probably spying on me...<br />

'''Bigby:''' Anyway...<br />

'''Snow:''' No, it's fine. You did... Excellent work, Bigby.

|-|The Crooked Man's door moves.=

'''Bigby:''' I had to get real persuasive with the Jersey Devil, down at the Lucky Pawn, but he told me that the Crooked Man's door...to wherever it is he hangs his hat...it moves! It's some kind of magic door.<br />

'''Snow:''' Do you think the mirror will be able to find the door...once it's fixed?<br />

'''Bigby:''' That's how Crane did it. And that's how we're gonna do it.<br />

'''Snow:''' Excellent work. Really.

|-|All of Fabletown is involved.=

'''Bigby:''' I gotta say...this thing reaches a lot further than we thought. The Crooked Man has something on everybody. It wasn't just Beauty and the loan. Beast was working for him. His goon, the Jersey Devil, is putting the squeeze on all kinds of Fables down at the Lucky Pawn.

{{#tag:tabber|(Went to butcher shop first)=

'''Bigby:''' And he's got Fables enslaved at the butcher shop, making black market magic.<br />

'''Snow:''' This is worse than we could have imagined...

{{!}}-{{!}}(Went to pawn shop first)=

'''Bigby:''' He was even running black market magic out of the butcher shop.

}}

'''Bigby:''' But that's over now. Because we got the mirror. And once it's fixed? We got him. That's how Crane did it. And that's how we're gonna do it.<br />

'''Snow:''' Excellent work. Really.

|-|...=

'''Snow:''' Alright.

</tabber>

'''Bufkin:''' Sheriff, I could use your assistance. Would you join me at the mirror?

'''Bluebeard:''' Don't go far, Sheriff. I'd like to have a few words of my own with you.

'''Toad:''' Unbelievable. Pompous ass.

<tabber>Take a number.=

'''Bigby:''' Oh yeah? Take a number.

|-|Fuck off until I'm ready.=

'''Bigby:''' Why don't you go fuck off until I'm good and ready?<br />

''Bluebear will remember that.''

|-|You burned Crane's shit.=

(If Bigby went to Crane's apartment after Bluebeard.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' ''(turns around)'' Why the hell did you burn Crane's stuff, huh? And don't bullshit me, Bufkin was there. I know it was you.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' Given Ichabod's obsession with Miss White, ''(walks up to Bigby)'' I thought it best to make sure that nothing untoward saw the light of day.<br />

'''Bigby:''' ''(walks up to Bluebeard)'' Oh, fuck off. I know you were burning evidence.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' Then tell me, what evidence did I burn?<br />

'''Bigby:''' I have more important things to deal with right now. But you can be sure that we're gonna have a long fucking talk about this when I'm done.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' I do so enjoy our talks. I'll wait with bated breath.

|-|Why did you attack Flycatcher?=

(If Bigby went to the Tweedles' office after Bluebeard.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' ''(turns around)'' Why‘d you put the hurt on Flycatcher? Were you hiding something down at the Tweedles? Or was it just for fun?<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' He worked for them didn’t he? ''(walks up to Bigby)'' I couldn’t be sure he wasn’t involved. And I didn’t want him interfering. ''(Bigby walks up to him)'' I was simply endeavoring to make the search a speedy one. Surely you of all people can’t fault me for getting...overzealous in the process.<br />

'''Bigby:''' I don’t buy it. I have more important things to deal with right now. But you can be sure that we're gonna have a long fucking talk about this when I'm done.<br />

'''Bluebeard:''' I do so enjoy our talks. I'll wait with bated breath.

|-|We'll talk soon.=

(If Bigby didn't go to the office/apartment after Bluebeard.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' Don't worry. We'll talk soon. You can count on it.

Bigby walks over to Bufkin.

'''Bluebeard:''' ''(in background)'' And that's another thing. Have you completely given up on finding Crane?

'''Snow:''' ''(in background)'' The Crooked Man is our concern, now.

'''Bufkin:''' I don't understand...this piece just doesn't want to join the rest. Do you have any idea why?

'''Bluebeard:''' ''(in background)'' Did he murder those prostitutes?

'''Bigby:''' You got me.

'''Snow:''' ''(in background)'' Not necessarily...personally. But we believe he is ultimately responsible.

'''Bufkin:''' Well, where did you find it? What has it gone through since being separated from the rest?

'''Toad:''' ''(in background)'' Oh, is that what you need to do around here to get some attention? Murder someone?

'''Bufkin:''' Shattering is a very traumatic experience, you know. So this process can be a little touchy.

'''Bluebeard:''' ''(in background)'' Tell that stupid reptile to hold his tongue.

'''Toad:''' ''(in background)'' That's quite the wit we have, innit?

'''Bufkin:''' It helps that I have a good working relationship with the mirror. And I don't mind speaking in rhyme.

'''Snow:''' ''(in background)'' I told you, now is not a good time! Can you please just wait and--

'''Toad:''' ''(in background)'' Now's a perfect time. You could build a mountain of goodwill with those of us in steerage if you made this right.

'''Snow:''' ''(in background)'' I will do my best to try--

'''Bluebeard:''' ''(in background)'' I can't believe you're even entertaining this! He's endangering all of us. Running around without a glamour. He needs to go to the Farm... At the very least, out of my sight.

'''Toad:''' ''(in background)'' Last time I checked, you weren't Sheriff.

'''Bluebeard:''' ''(in background)'' I went out and did my part. What are you doing to find Crane?

<tabber>It was at the Lucky Pawn. / It was at the Butcher Shop.=

{{#tag:tabber|(Went to pawn shop first)=

{{!}}-{{!}}(Went to butcher shop first)=

'''Bigby:''' I found it at the butcher shop, The Cut Above. It was in Crane's coat. There was a lot of weird magic going on there, if that has something to do with it. Other than that?

}}

'''Bigby:''' Last person I saw with Crane, or his coat, was that psycho Bloody Mary. Maybe she had some--

'''Bufkin:''' Ah, yes. Miss White was asking about her. That explains it! You-know-who and the Mirror have a very...unhappy history with each other. How would you like it if she tired to use you as a doorway?

'''Bigby:''' I think I already know the feeling...

'''Bufkin:''' Well, I think I know how to proceed, now. It will just take a little extra...coaxing. That's all. Thank you for your help.

|-|Crane had it on him.=

'''Bigby:''' Crane was carrying it for part of the night, at least. I found it in his coat. It's pretty amazing it's still intact after the fight, the kidnapping, and then riding around with Bloody Mary for however--<br />

'''Bufkin:''' Ah, yes. Miss White was asking about her. That explains it! You-know-who and the Mirror have a very...unhappy history with each other. How would you like it if she tired to use you as a doorway?<br />

Bigby shrugs.<br />

'''Bufkin:''' I shall labor on, then. This will take some...coaxing.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' ''(in background)'' We've got enough problems right now, okay?

'''Bluebeard:''' ''(in background)'' I see. You're at a loss, so now you're interested in my search.

'''Bufkin:''' It could be a while, Sheriff. I'll find you when it's ready. Besides which...he might not want to come out with you watching.

'''Bigby:''' Oh, he doesn't like being spied on?

Bufkin shrugs.

'''Bluebeard:''' ''(in background)'' If you ask me, you're everything that's wrong with Fabletown. Always with your hand out. Zero sense of self reliance.

Bigby returns to Snow.

'''Snow:''' Is it fixed? Did you ask about the Crooked Man?

'''Toad:''' ''(in background)'' Oh, and you're Walt Whitman, I take it.

'''Bigby:''' Bufkin's still working on it. He said it might be a while.

'''Toad:''' If you're so self-reliant, what do you want from the Business Office so bad?

'''Bluebeard:''' What I want is my business.

'''Snow:''' I can't take those two right now.

'''Bluebeard:''' ''(in background)'' I pay dearly for it to be so.

'''Toad:''' ''(in background)'' You pay to put a shine o' decency on your dealings, you do. But you can only shine a turd so much.

'''Snow:''' We're trying to catch a murderer, and they're... They're over there bickering about bureaucracy!

'''Bluebeard:''' ''(in background)'' What the devil is that supposed to mean?

'''Toad:''' ''(in background)'' It means read a book sometime, ya pompous git.

'''Snow:''' We're...at war! Don't they realize that?

'''Toad:''' ''(in background)'' That's right. You're always in here, muckin' about.

'''Bluebeard:''' ''(in background)'' What's good for me is good for Fabletown.

'''Bigby:''' Do you need some help over there?

'''Snow:''' Yeah, thanks.

'''Toad:''' ''(in background)'' Actually, that's where you're wrong.

'''Bluebeard:''' ''(in background)'' I'm sure experience has given you that impression.

'''Snow:''' Go talk to Toad. But, just so you know, we can't pay him.

'''Toad:''' ''(in background)'' Sod off, cueball.

'''Bluebeard:''' ''(in background)'' You should learn to treat your betters with the appropriate respect.

'''Snow:''' He really needs to go to the Farm, you know. So, just break the news and be done with it, okay?

'''Toad:''' ''(in background)'' That Snow White is no better than Crane! No budge on the bloody glamour. I only came in to see about a bit of dosh for the damages!

Snow sits down behind her desk. Bigby leans against a nearby table.

'''Bigby:''' Toad! Come here.

Toad walks over to Bigby.

'''Snow:''' ''(in background)'' I thought I made myself very clear.

'''Bluebeard:''' ''(in background)'' He's the one who let Crane get away, isn't he? It's a very strange decision for the Sheriff to make.

'''Snow:''' ''(in background)'' We do things the right way.

'''Bluebeard:''' ''(in background)'' I wouldn't be so sure.

'''Toad:''' I see how it is. Passed off to an underling, eh? Why am I not surprised? Well, you did cause what damage brings me in here, so maybe it's for the best. Just need a little bit of dosh to cover it. I tried talking to her about it, but it's like chatting up a brick wall, it is.

'''Snow:''' ''(in background)'' So... is there anything else you want to tell me?

'''Bluebeard:''' ''(in background)'' I expected you'd ask about him. But as far as questions go, it's a bit broad, don't you think? We've met. He's a scratch golfer. But it's always been...casually arranged. In fact, if I remember correctly, he just shows up and leaves...very much at his own convenience. If you're waiting me to volunteer information, I simply don't have any. One rarely spills their secrets over a round of golf.

'''Toad:''' Now I'm sure you've got your own agenda, Sheriff. But I've taken a real wallop because of you. And you can't deny that.

<tabber>Where's the glamour?=

'''Bigby:''' I'm starting to think you don't take me seriously, Toad. How many times have I told you to get glamoured up? You know that if you're out of glamour, I gotta send you to the Farm.

|-|Hey, I tried to pay you.=

(If Bigby tried to give Toad money at the pawn shop.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' Hey, I tried to give you money back at the Lucky Pawn, but you wouldn't take it.<br />

'''Toad:''' I was just being polite. Ever heard of it? That wouldn't have covered the cab ride home, let alone a glamour. Please, I'm not looking for any more than to cover the big-ticket damages. Not a cent more. I'm not looking for a handout. Just what's right. I need it, Bigby.

'''Toad:''' Well... How about your friend, the pig, hm? Is he going to the Farm too? Yeah, you thought we didn't know about him, huh? The worst kept secret in Fabletown. For a friend, the rules'll bend. That's a slippery slope, that is.

'''Toad:''' If you give me one more chance, and hear me out, I see a way for me and me boy to stay. I'm not gonna ask for any more than I need. I just want to stay. So whaddya say you just give me enough to cover me glamours, and we'll...call the rest a wash? Please, Sheriff. Don't take TJ from the only home he knows. This whole glamour rule is...oppressive. I've done nothing wrong but look different. You know it's not right... Burdenring the weakest of us like this. This world isn't kind to those of us who can't pass for human.

{{#tag:tabber|I'll do what I can.=

''You chose to send Toad to the Farm.''<br />

'''Toad:''' Bigby...<br />

'''Bigby:''' Look, the damages might be a valid complaint, but that's separate deal. Weyland Smith can see to that...at the Farm.<br />

{{!}}-{{!}}It won't be forever.=

'''Bigby:''' Look, you were unglamoured three days ago and you're still unglamoured now. I can't ignore that. But...you go to the Farm, things cool down here a bit, maybe you can come back at some point. Best I can do.<br />

Toad walks away, either whistling and skipping happily if Bigby gave him money or said he'd do what he could, or unhappily if Bigby sent him to the Farm.

'''Bigby:''' Bluebeard! You wanna talk? Now's your chance.

'''Bluebeard:''' I've just made my donation funding this office, so direct your questions to Miss White.

Bluebeard leaves the office.

'''Snow:''' Well, at least he's not trying to get rid of me...

'''Bigby:''' He's not?

'''Snow:''' For now... Did you take care of Toad? I mean... I saw the way he left... I know it may not seem that important right now. But glamours are the law for a very good reason. You know that as well as anyone.

'''Snow:''' I know I should be asking how it got like this... But I just keep wondering why it happened...to Faith and Lily. You've seen his world. Do you have any idea why he'd want them dead? I don't know if the Crooked Man killed them with his own hand, or if it was one of his goons... But someone did. What would make a person do that? What could those girls have done?

<tabber>It's about control.=

'''Bigby:''' If there's one thing I've figured out, its't hat the Crooked Man is all about control. It's what he does with the loans at the Pawn Shop, the magic he peddles...chains...ribbons. Maybe Faith and Lily weren't doing what they were told. Or...maybe they just tried to leave.

|-|Money is all he cares about.=

'''Bigby:''' Guys like the Crooked Man...all they care about is money. That's what all his operations were about. Maybe Faith and Lily weren't bringing enough money in. Or...maybe they were just trying to find a way out.

'''Snow:''' I'm sorry. I just--I have to know... Mirror, mirror...we're glad you weren't slain. Now please show us...that sick creep crane.

'''Bufkin:''' He's probably still...waking up a little.

<tabber>Is that a good idea?=

'''Bigby:''' Are you really sure you wanna see him?

'''Bigby:''' Yeah, I wanna see where he's ended up, too.

The Mirror shows Mary and Crane standing outside a cab.

'''Mary:''' You will get on that plane to Paris and you will wait for the day the Crooked Man needs you. Until then, not a peep. Otherwise, I get to deal with you my way. So please...please disobey. Wait a minute... Someone's watching.

Mary looks out through the mirror and raises her hand, distorting the view.

'''Mirror:''' What...just happened?

'''Bufkin:''' We pointed you in the wrong direction...and looked at Bloody Mary's reflection.

'''Mirror:''' Oh...her. That explains the sting. I'd rather not have to feel the pain she brings. So...let's not do that again, okay?

'''Bigby:''' Looks like we'll have to track him down later.

'''Snow:''' You're right. We need to focus on the immediate threat. And that's the Crooked Man. Bigby, we don't have a lot of time.

'''Bufkin:''' Are you having trouble with the rhyme, Sheriff?

<tabber>Show me where Crooked Man is.=

'''Bigby:''' Just show me where I can find the Crooked Man.<br />

'''Mirror:''' I haven't been feeling well, of late. Seems neither of us can cooperate.<br />

'''Bigby:''' I don't recognize the door, but...that's the Crooked Man's symbol on it.

'''Mirror:''' Hold on...

The symbol fades from the door. The Mirror shows another door, where the symbol reappears.

'''Snow:''' The door...it moves...

'''Bigby:''' That's Central Park. I don't know when it's gonna move again, but I'm gonna get there before it does.

'''Snow:''' Bigby, wait. When you get the Crooked Man...make sure you bring him back alive. He has to stand trial.

<tabber>(Killed Dum)=

'''Snow:''' This can't be like it was with Tweedle Dum. I don't care if it gets out of hand. You don't let it come to that.

|-|(Didn't kill Dum)=

'''Snow:''' We can't just dispense street justice.

</tabber>

'''Snow:''' I know that emotions can run high. And you have your reasons to handle this a certain way. But we have to make a commitment to working within the law.

<tabber>I'll bring him back alive.=

'''Bigby:''' I'll catch him and bring him back here. Alive. Then we can clean him and cook him together.<br />

'''Snow:''' Good.

|-|No guarantees.=

'''Bigby:''' I can't make that promise. This could turn sour, just depending on how the wind blows. I have to be able to handle it how I see fit.<br />

''Snow will remember that.''<br />

'''Snow:''' If people are going to have faith in the Fabletown government again, we need to be fair. Show them that we're doing things the right way.

|-|Easier to kill him.=

Bigby runs through the park and reaches the door.

Bigby either kicks or pulls open the door, revealing a portal. He charges through it, arriving in a new location.

==Crooked Man's Lair==

The symbol on the wall behind Bigby disappears. He hears someone approaching, and hides behind the wall. [[Tiny Tim]] turns the corner.

'''Bigby:''' Tim? What the hell are you doing here?

'''Tim:''' Good evening, Sheriff. I'm here to take you to the boss. ''(offers hand)'' Thanks, by the way...for leaving off "Tiny". "Tiny Tim". You'd think I'd have outgrown that centuries ago.

<tabber>[Shake Hand]=

Bigby shakes Tim's hand.<br />

'''Tim:''' I have to admit, when they asked me to watch the door... I wasn't sure what to expect when you came through that portal. I know you aren't here on a social call. So thanks for not giving me a hard time.

|-|[Smack Hand Away]=

Bigby smacks Tim's hand away.<br />

'''Tim:''' What? I know this isn't a social call... But I'm just watching the door, here. Then again, I guess I don't know what else I should have expected...

|-|[Don't Shake] / ...=

Bigby crosses his arms. Tim drops his hand.<br />

'''Tim:''' That's what they told me. I dunno, they said you made it pretty clear.

|-|Kinda small for a guard...=

'''Bigby:''' You know, I kinda thought the Crooked Man would have bigger guards. Trolls. Ogres. I'm almost insulted he doesn't.<br />

'''Tim:''' Maybe he just wants to talk.

|-|Where the hell am I?=

'''Bigby:''' What is this place? Or...where is it? I know I'm not in Central Park anymore.<br />

'''Tim:''' I'm not sure. I've only ever come in through one of the portals. I don't think you can get in from the actual street. But you can't blame him for wanting to make it hard to find.

Tim and Bigby start walking down the hallway.

<tabber>(Wasn't rude to Tim)=

'''Tim:''' Thanks for understanding. This is all I'm here to do, and...I don't want to mess it up.

</tabber>

'''Tim:''' I know I'm probably the last person you'd expect to be a...guard. Or an escort, for that matter. I was a little surprised, myself, when they asked me to do it. I thought it was a joke, actually. I'm...an easy target.

<tabber>You're a part of this.=

'''Bigby:''' Tim, how can you be working here? You know who this guy is, don't you?<br />

'''Tim:''' He's not... He's not as bad as you think.

|-|It's dangerous for you here.=

'''Bigby:''' You shouldn't be here, Tim. This place is dangerous. Especially for someone...like you.<br />

'''Tim:''' It's...not like that. Whatever you may think of him...

|-|I know you have a job to do.=

'''Bigby:''' I get it. You have a job to do. But you gotta ask yourself if you wanna be involved with this guy.<br />

'''Tim:''' Whatever you may think of him...

|-|...=

'''Tim:''' But he takes me seriously...

</tabber>

'''Tim:''' He doesn't treat me like some...broken little kid. I think he gets what it's like. He gave me a job. And I'm lucky to have it. This is the only option I've got. Just...keep that in mind, maybe? 'Cause if you and the boss go up against each other...the rest of Fabletown is gonna get caught in the middle. And if you're here, it can't be good. So I hope you two can...come to an understanding.

<tabber>Find another job.=

'''Bigby:''' I understand the position you're in, but you don't have to do this. There are other things you could do.<br />

'''Tim:''' So it's just that easy?<br />

'''Bigby:''' Maybe not, but you don't want to be a part of this.

|-|You should leave now.=

'''Bigby:''' I can find the door myself. You should just get the hell outta here. Things are gonna get ugly in a minute.<br />

'''Tim:''' Leave? I told you, I have to do this.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Hey, you've been warned. Stick around and you're a part of this, just like anyone else.

|-|Working here means you're involved.=

'''Bigby:''' Don't you realize you're not just minding the door? You work for that crooked bastard, your hands get dirty too.<br />

'''Tim:''' It's not so bad.<br />

'''Bigby:''' Not so bad? Are you fucking blind, Tim? He's a murderer.<br />

'''Tim:''' So you're telling me you agree with everything Crane does?

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Tim:''' A lot of us depend on him. Some of us never get to the front of the line at the Business Office. But he's there. We need you...but we need him too. What we don't need is a war.

Bigby starts walkign ahead of Tim.

'''Tim:''' Hey, Sheriff, hold up... I gotta go in with you. Can't you just wait up, Sheriff? Hold on!

<tabber>I'm in a hurry.=

'''Bigby:''' I don't have time for this.<br />

'''Tim:''' God bless us everyone.

|-|[Wait for him] / ...=

Bigby stops walking.<br />

'''Tim:''' Thanks.

Bigby and determinantly Tim arrive in front of a pair of double doors. Jersey laughs from inside the room.

'''Georgie:''' ''(from inside room)'' Am I some kind of a fucking joke to you? What did I tell you, eh? Stop laughin' at me.

'''Jersey:''' ''(from inside room)'' Oh, yeah? Make me. I ain't scared of you. It's the wolf I got a problem with.

'''Crooked Man:''' ''(from inside room)'' You needn't worry. He'll come around. And like Crane before him, I'm sure he will prove himself quite handy to have in my pocket. Either he's smart enough to see this is for the best...or dim enough to do as he's told.

Dee, Jersey, Georgie, Vivian, the Crooked Man, and determinantly Dum are gathered in the room. Jersey starts to walk toward Bigby, but the Crooked Man gestures for him to stop.

'''Crooked Man:''' You see? Everyone in Fabletown has a role to fill. You just have to pay attention to what they need to help them find it. Why don't you have a seat, Sheriff? We have a great deal to discuss.

<tabber>No. You're coming with me.=

==Crooked Man's Lair==

'''Crooked Man:''' You've come a long way. You must be tired.

''Crooked Man's Lair''<br />''Night''

Bigby smokes a cigarette. Jersey takes out a gun.

'''Crooked Man:''' And if my envoys are correct...you haven't had a lot of rest recently... Please, Sheriff... Relax for a moment, will you? Do you want a drink? Something to eat? Vivian makes a very nice, very...it's elegant, really, her carpaccio. It's lobster...sirloin... Well, gramercy me, take a seat at the very least...

<tabber>I'll have a drink.=

'''Bigby:''' Got a scotch?<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' Only Tennessee whiskey, unfortunately.

|-|We're not friends.=

'''Bigby:''' Don't misunderstand the situation here. We? Are not friends. And you're in no position to offer me anything.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' On the contrary, Sheriff...and I don't wish to contradict you here...but your initiative and mien have been friendly for a long while now. Ever since I came aboard these shores, you know... Fabletown's been very accommodating of my humble ventures. Never said a bad word. And that relationship's worked till these ends.

{{#tag:tabber|That's over with.=

'''Bigby:''' Yeah? Well you can forget all that, that's over with.

{{!}}-{{!}}What are you talking about?=

'''Bigby:''' Just what are you talking about?<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' I've just been left in relative peace, I think puts it best. Allowed to live my own way.

{{!}}-{{!}}That was Crane, not me.=

'''Bigby:''' That was Crane who let you do whatever you wanted. I'm. Not. Crane.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' No, you're not.

{{!}}-{{!}}...=

'''Crooked Man:''' So why impair what's thus far been such an agreeable union?

}}

|-|I'm here for one reason.=

(If Bigby didn't say "No, you're coming with me" in Episode 4)<br />

'''Bigby:''' I'm here for one reason. And it's not to eat your fuckin' food.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' Really?<br />

'''Bigby:''' Yeah.

|-|I told you, it's over.=

(If Bigby said "No, you're coming with me" in Episode 4)<br />

'''Bigby:''' I told you, Crooked Man. It's over.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' Really?<br />

'''Bigby:''' Yeah.

|-|...=

'''Crooked Man:''' No?

</tabber>

Bigby stubs out his cigarette. Jersey stands up and aims his gun at him.

'''Crooked Man:''' What do you think you're doing?

'''Jersey:''' He's gonna--

'''Crooked Man:''' Mr. Wolf is our guest. And I have every intention of cooperating. So don't waste the silver. Sit down, Jersey.

Jersey puts the gun away and sits back down. Georgie starts smoking.

'''Crooked Man:''' Well, Sheriff... For the sake of transparency, why don't you tell us why you're here... It would help settle everyone's nerves, I think.

<tabber>You killed those women.=

'''Bigby:''' You know why I'm here. You killed those women.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' What women?<br />

'''Bigby:''' Faith and Lily. The girls who worked at the Pudding N' Pie.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' Did I now? I assume by your confidence in accusing me, you must have some proof of this, yes? Some allotment of evidence? A witness, perhaps. Mm?

{{#tag:tabber|Jersey told me you did it.=

'''Bigby:''' Your servant over there told me you did it.<br />

'''Jersey:''' That's a fuckin' lie! I didn't say anything like that!<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' It's fine.<br />

'''Jersey:''' All I said was that this was your town and nothin' wouldn't happen without your approval! Alright? That's it!<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' If only that were true...

{{!}}-{{!}}I know you did it.=

'''Bigby:''' I know you did it.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' I'm sorry, Sheriff. I wish you had me dead to rights, I really do, for your own sake. But no... I didn't kill anyone.

{{!}}-{{!}}I don't NEED evidence.=

'''Bigby:''' I don't need evidence. I don't carry a badge, there's no appeals... And you're guilty until I say otherwise. That's how this works.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' I'm sorry, Sheriff. I wish you had me dead to rights, I really do, for your own sake. But no... I didn't kill anyone.

{{!}}-{{!}}...=

'''Crooked Man:''' I'm sorry, Sheriff. I wish you had me dead to rights, I really do, for your own sake. But no... I didn't kill anyone.

}}

'''Crooked Man:''' Those women... I don't relish telling you that the killings were perpetrated by an employee of mine.

|-|You're destroying this town.=

'''Bigby:''' You're destroying this town. You've been doing it for ages.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' "Destroying this town"? What on Earth do you mean?<br />

'''Bigby:''' What the hell do you think I mean? Slavery, kidnapping, extortion, murder. What would you call the wholesale corruption of Fabletown?<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' I would call it the baseless accusation of a desperate Sheriff. How are you certain this isn't some...conspiracy against me? I'm a well-connected man... Well-moneyed. People do like to take their shots at me.

{{#tag:tabber|Who would do that?=

'''Bigby:''' Who would try to pull that on you.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' Oh, I don't know. Fables with a grudge, people who want a stake in my shops and services... But I can understand the confusion. And I am truly sorry about...the trouble all of this has caused you. And I hope you believe me when I say, Sheriff, that I sincerely meant to make it up to you.

{{!}}-{{!}}You can't play me.=

'''Bigby:''' Don't try to play me. It won't work.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' I'm not trying to control you. I have no need for treachery, Bigby. I do everything right out in the open. But I can understand the confusion. And I am truly sorry about...the trouble all of this has caused you. And I hope you believe me when I say, Sheriff, that I sincerely meant to make it up to you.

{{!}}-{{!}}You're behind the conspiracy.=

'''Bigby:''' You're right that there's a conspiracy, but you're the one behind it.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' There's no need for treachery, Bigby. I do everything right out in the open. But I can understand the confusion. And I am truly sorry about...the trouble all of this has caused you. And I hope you believe me when I say, Sheriff, that I sincerely meant to make it up to you.

'''Crooked Man:''' The recent murders that have gotten such attention as of late... I don't relish telling you that they were perpetrated by an employee of mine.

|-|You tried to kill me.=

'''Bigby:''' You forget what happened at the Pudding N' Pie? You and your goons tried to kill me.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' I'm truly sorry for that whole debacle. It was not my intention to put you or Miss White in any sort of danger. My wish was merely to take Crane, Sheriff, and as soon as the assignment grew out of control, I put a stop to it. I know that it doesn't change what happened to you. And I can only offer my sincerest apologies.

{{#tag:tabber|I don't give a shit.=

'''Bigby:''' I don't really give a shit if you're "sorry", Crooked Man.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' No, I understand, of course. And I hope you believe me when I say, Sheriff, that I sincerely mean to make it up to you.

{{!}}-{{!}}Crane wasn't yours to take.=

'''Bigby:''' Crane wasn't yours to take.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' I apologize if I overstepped my bounds. Won't happen again. And I hope you believe me when I say, Sheriff, that I sincerely mean to make it up to you.

{{!}}-{{!}}Snow stopped it, not you.=

'''Bigby:''' You didn't stop it out of the kindness of your heart, you stopped it because Snow White offered up Crane.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' That may have appeared to you to be the case, but I assure you, it wasn't. And I hope you believe me when I say, Sheriff, that I sincerely mean to make it up to you.

'''Crooked Man:''' Going to make me guess, are you? Very well. The recent murders that have gotten such attention as of late... I don't relish telling you that they were perpetrated by an employee of mine.

</tabber>

'''Crooked Man:''' It's a very unfortunate bit of business, but... I promise you that the matter will be dealt with. Internally. I just want to settle the issue for you. And to assure you that it's over with. You really don't need to worry yourself further.

<tabber>Who did it!?=

'''Bigby:''' An "unfortunate bit of business"? You're gonna tell me right now who killed them.<br />

''The Crooked Man will remember that.''<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' Sheriff, I have complete respect for you and your job. I hope you know that. But I simply can't divulge that information.

|-|I know who did it.=

'''Bigby:''' I already know who did it.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' Forgive me, Sheriff, for doubting your acumen, but...who do you think committed these crimes? It's been a long couple of days for you. Perhaps you've become somewhat unscrewed.

{{#tag:tabber|It was Georgie.=

'''Bigby:''' It was Georgie, alright?<br />

''The Crooked Man will remember that.''<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' Well done, Sheriff, I'm sorry I doubted you. However, like I said...I'll be handling the matter, if you don't mind.

{{!}}-{{!}}It was Bloody Mary.=

'''Bigby:''' It was Mary.<br />

''The Crooked Man will remember that.''<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' No Sheriff. I'm afraid your mistaken. And I have complete respect for you and your job, I really do, but I'm sorry, I simply can't divulge the transgressor.

{{!}}-{{!}}It was the Tweedles.=

'''Bigby:''' The Tweedles did it.<br />

''The Crooked Man will remember that.''<br />

'''Dee:''' What the fuck makes you think I did it?<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' No Sheriff. I'm afraid your mistaken. And I have complete respect for you and your job, I really do, but I'm sorry, I simply can't divulge the transgressor.

{{!}}-{{!}}It was you.=

'''Bigby:''' Don't give me this "employee" bullshit. I know it was you.<br />

''The Crooked Man will remember that.''<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' What must I say to convince you that I'm innocent, dear? It wasn't me. And I have complete respect for you and your job, I really do, but I'm sorry, I simply can't divulge the transgressor.

<tabber>(Didn't say it was Georgie)=

'''Crooked Man:''' You really shouldn't worry yourself. As I said, I've got this under control.<br />

'''Bigby:''' No. I'm gonna deal with it. Right. Now.<br />

'''Jersey:''' Yeah, right...<br />

'''Dee:''' What do you think this is? Some kind of negotiation? The man said he'd take care of it. So why don't you take the hint and get out.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' Tweedle Dee, please.

'''Bigby:''' Georgie.

'''Jersey:''' ''(stands up)'' You got what you wanted, so just--

'''Crooked Man:''' Sit. Down. Now.

Jersey sits down.

'''Georgie:''' Yeah, I killed 'em. So what? You should've just kept your nose where it fuckin' belonged.

</tabber>

'''Crooked Man:''' Look, the fact is... George here misinterpreted one of my instructions...

'''Georgie:''' Misinterpreted?!

'''Crooked Man:''' And I want to make things right. So...let's work something out.

'''Georgie:''' What's there to work out? I'm protected, aren't I?

'''Crooked Man:''' Your protection has limits...and I think you've far exceeded yours. That you could murder someone in cold blood like that...

'''Georgie:''' You fuckin' asked me to do this! You told me to kill them!

'''Crooked Man:''' And then attempt to blame me for it! You will be silent...while we discuss what to do with you.

'''Georgie:''' This is right bollocks, this! You're just gonna let him do this?

'''Crooked Man:''' So what do you say, Sheriff? Can we discuss terms? You can have Georgie... Consider it a gift...ensuring out continued cooperation.

'''Vivian:''' What the hell?

'''Georgie:''' Take this fucker! Take all of 'em! I didn't fuckin' start this!

'''Jersey:''' Don't make any trouble, Georgie.

'''Georgie:''' Are you seriously throwin' me under the fuckin' carriage? After everything I've done for you?

<tabber>OK, let's talk.=

'''Bigby:''' Alright. Let's talk.<br />

'''Georgie:''' You can't just hand me over!

'''Georgie:''' What the fuck is this shit! You said you'd cover for us!

'''Crooked Man:''' For minor infractions, not murder.

'''Jersey:''' Just go with him, Georgie! You're gonna sink us all!

'''Vivian:''' What's wrong with you people! You're really gonna sell him out just like that?

'''Georgie:''' You think I give a fuck if I'm the one who--who the shit do you think you fuckers are?

'''Jersey:''' Just surrender!

'''Dee:''' Get the fuck out of here!

'''Crooked Man:''' I do apologize, Sheriff...but I think it's best if you leave now.

'''Georgie:''' There's no way I'm going with him! Are you kidding me!

'''Crooked Man:''' Things are about to get unpleasant, and I would rather you weren't here to watch.

'''Georgie:''' You can go join that whore at the bottom of the lake for all I give a shit! But he's not takin' me anywhere! I'll roll over on the lot of you before I let that shit happen.

'''Jersey:''' What are you saying?

'''Dee:''' Yeah. What the fuck? You're gonna make sure we all go down the shitter with you?

'''Jersey:''' I told you!

Bigby kicks over the coffee table, and Georgie moves away from him.<br />

'''Georgie:''' Get the fuck away from me! He's the one you fuckin' want!

|-|[Grab Crooked Man]=

Bigby kicks over the coffee table.<br />

'''Bigby:''' I'm running out of patience, Crooked Man. I don't have time to fuck around here!

'''Bigby:''' I already told you. I'm taking both of you in. So let's go!

|-|I'm not leaving.=

(If Bigby said anything else.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' I'm not going anywhere!

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Crooked Man:''' This could have gone so well... But you just had to complicate things. To speak the truth, I've never been a very good mediator... Why negotiate when you can just decide.

Bigby looks in the nearby mirror and sees Mary's reflection. She walks closer until she emerges from the glass and into the room.

'''Mary:''' Did I miss anything good? Well, look at you...all fixed up?

Georgie hits Bigby with a table, and Mary kicks him in the face, knocking him to the floor. He stands back up, now in werewolf form. Jersey removes his glamour. He, Dee, and determinantly Dum approach Bigby.

<tabber>Punch Dee=

Bigby punches Dee in the face.

|-|Punch Jersey=

Bigby punches Jersey in the face.

</tabber>

Jersey jumps toward Bigby, who grabs Jersey by the throat, then throws him against the wall.

<tabber>(Killed Dum)=

'''Georgie:''' Over here!

|-|(Didn't kill Dum)=

'''Dum:''' Take this!

</tabber>

Georgie/Dum tosses the gun to Dee, who aims at Bigby. He smacks the gun out of his hand just as he fires; the bullet hits the stained glass window and shatters it to reveal a portal. Bigby kicks Dum in the knee, knocking him down. Jersey stands up. Georgie draws a knife.

'''Georgie:''' You're done, wolf!

'''Mary:''' Come on. We're pretty much done here.

Mary and the Crooked Man jump through the portal. Bigby prepares to attack the others approaching him, but Dee jumps up and grabs him.

'''Georgie:''' I'd like to say it was nice knowin' you... But I'll be glad to see your insides turned out.

'''Dee:''' Gut him! Now!

Bigby turns to the side as Georgie swings the knife, and he ends up stabbing Dee. He releases Bigby and falls to the floor. If Dum is alive, he runs over to him. Georgie tries to stab Bigby, but he grabs his wrist and takes the knife from him, stabbing him in the stomach.

'''Vivian:''' Oh, god!

Jersey tries to hit Bigby with a floor light, which he can get hit by if he does nothing. He grabs the weapon and wrestles for it with Jersey.

'''Vivian:''' Come on! This way!

Vivian and Georgie walk through the portal. Bigby swings the floor light, throwing Jersey across the room. He can hit him with the light or toss it on the ground. Bigby charges into the portal.

==Street==

Vivian helps Georgie into a car.

'''Vivian:''' Come on, Georgie!

'''Georgie:''' Shit.

'''Vivian:''' I know, I know.

Bigby emerges from the portal in a brick wall, in his werewolf form. Vivian gets in the car and tries to drive away. Bigby grabs the back bumper, keeping the car from moving.

'''Vivian:''' Shit.

Bigby takes his wolfman form. The bumper of the car breaks off, and they drive away, with Bigby chasing after them. He runs between the gap in two trucks before they crash into each other. He dodges a few cars. He can continue to run on the street and dodge vehicles or jump along the top of several buses. He then bursts into a building and climbs up to the roof. He jumps across several rooftops, then onto the highway. He leaps off the edge.

<tabber>(Go after Georgie and Vivian)=

Bigby lands on the car.<br />

'''Vivian:''' Shit.<br />

'''Georgie:''' Fuck! What was that?<br />

The other car veers away. Bigby can smash the windshield or side window, or punch the car roof. Vivian then swerves the car back and forth.<br />

'''Georgie:''' Shake him off!<br />

'''Vivian:''' I can't!<br />

Vivian abruptly stops the car, throwing Bigby off the roof. He gets up and sees their car at the end of an alley.<br />

'''Georgie:''' Gun it!<br />

'''Vivian:''' Are you sure?<br />

'''Georgie:''' Do it!<br />

Vivian drives forward.<br />

'''Vivian:''' He's not moving.<br />

'''Georgie:''' Keep going!

{{#tag:tabber|Dodge=

Bigby jumps to the side and climbs up the wall onto the roof. He sees Georgie and Bigby outside the Pudding & Pie.<br />

'''Georgie:''' Ah, fuck!<br />

'''Vivian:''' Come on...<br />

'''Georgie:''' Fucking...<br />

The two of them go inside the building. Bigby returns to human form and gets dressed with the outfit on a nearby clothesline.

This was supposed to be our place. We were gonna be in charge for once, and nobody would try to control us, or use us... That was the point. Then the Crooked Man showed up and everything just turned to shit.

'''Georgie:''' So do you get it now? Why I couldn't just--if you still think it's so fucking simple then you do it! Go right ahead! Kill her then!

'''Vivian:''' I can't pretend anymore.

Georgie steps toward Vivian and reaches out, but has to stop to grab his wound. Vivian takes off her ribbon, severing her head.

Mary jumps up and kicks him, then rips out a nearby pipe and swings it at him, which Bigby can dodge. Mary jumps on his back and starts to strangle him. He slams her against the machinery, then drops to the floor below. Bigby stands up, now in wolfman form. Mary is nowhere to be seen. Bigby looks around and sees her moving toward him, then turns and sees another Mary nearby. Several clones of her start to approach him. The Marys attack Bigby, slicing and stabbing him with their claws, and he knocks them away. One Mary knocks him over, and he punches her away. Several Marys grab him and hold him down, and the rest slash at him with their claws. Bigby stands up, now in his true wolf form. He crushes one Mary with his teeth and by throws another against the wall, and they shatter into glass shards. One clone jumps on his back and slices at him, and he falls backward onto the floor, crushing several clones, then stands back up. One Mary impales him with a metal rod, and he shatters her. Another clone stabs his legs, then jumps up to avoid his snapping jaws. He climbs up after her, trying to bite her but failing. She puts a rod between his teeth, preventing him from closing his mouth, but he crushes the metal and spits it out, then shatters her. He jumps back onto the floor and uses his paws to knock away several clones who rush at him. He gathers his breath, then uses his huff and puff ability to throw most of the clones against the wall, shattering them. The final Mary runs and jumps across the rafters. She pulls a shard of glass out of her head and jumps down to attack him. He jumps up and catches her in his jaws, crushing her the moment before she stabs him. Bigby growls, then returns to human form. He sees the Crooked Man in a room above the ground floor, so he gets dressed and enters the room.

'''Crooked Man:''' Hello, Bigby. You look tired.

'''Bigby:''' Give me one good reason not to rip you apart right now.

The Crooked Man aims a gun at him.

'''Crooked Man:''' This gun holds six rounds of specially designed silver bullets. Now, I may not be the best shot...but I can guarantee that at least one bolt will meet its mark and you'll find yourself rolling on the floor in agony. Unable to heal yourself. Without Swineheart to save you, you'll die. Is that reason enough for you?

<tabber>Optional interaction: attack Crooked Man=

Bigby rushes toward the Crooked Man, but he fires a warning shot, and Bigby stops.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' I won't miss next time.

</tabber>

'''Crooked Man:''' Before you do anything with me, I thought I should point out a few things. Snow White wants you to bring me back to the Woodlands, doesn't she? And that's what I want. You plan to do what she says, don't you?

<tabber>Don't be so sure.=

'''Bigby:''' You sure about that?<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' Yes... I'm quite sure.

|-|You're dealing with me now.=

'''Bigby:''' Snow's not here. You're dealing with me now.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' That may be true, but I'd advise against defying your new boss. At least for the time being.

|-|That's the plan.=

'''Bigby:''' That's right. But what happens to you once you get there is a different story.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' I'm not quite finished.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Crooked Man:''' You will bring me back alive. Look, all I ask for is a chance to speak for myself in front of the community. And I'm sure Miss White would agree that I should be given a fair trial. Can we at least agree on that? I will have a trial. Are we clear?

<tabber>Why would you want that?=

'''Bigby:''' The whole town will be calling for your execution. Why would you want me to bring you back there?<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' Why don't you let me worry about that?

|-|You won't be alive.=

'''Bigby:''' How about I bring your corpse back to the Woodlands instead?<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' You're not going to kill me.<br />

'''Bigby:''' You'd bet your life on that?

|-|Tell me now.=

'''Bigby:''' You need to tell me right now. We're not going anywhere until I get some answers from you.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' If you want your answers, you're going to have to cooperate with me.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Crooked Man:''' Look... There's no reason for us to be at each other's throats here.

'''Bigby:''' That's funny...coming from the guy pointing a gun at my head.

'''Crooked Man:''' This is just a precaution. I'm sure you understand. I'm no murderer, Mr. Wolf. I didn't kill those women. And I think you know that. All I'm asking for is a chance...to explain my side of the story.

<tabber>Bullshit.=

'''Bigby:''' Bull. Shit. I already talked to Georgie. I know you ordered their deaths.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' Mr. Porgie is mistaken. I assure you.

|-|Then what are you?=

'''Bigby:''' If you're not a killer, then what are you?

|-|I believe Georgie.=

'''Bigby:''' Maybe you didn't carry it out...but I don't think Georgie was lying when he said you ordered their deaths.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' Georgie would've said anything to save himself. We both know that.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Crooked Man:''' I'm a businessman. Not a killer.

'''Bigby:''' There's still a lot you have to answer for.

'''Crooked Man:''' And I will...as long as you agree to my terms. Because I'm not saying another word until I am brought before the community. I don't mean to belabor the point, but just so we're clear... If you change your mind and decide to do something stupid... You won't get your answers...but you will have a difficult time explaining yourself to Miss White and the rest of this miserable town. You're often reckless. And I worry you're not thinking of the--let me ask you an honest question... What do you really care about here? Where this case is concerned, I mean. Do you really want the truth...? Or do you just want to look like the hero? Because those are two very different things.

<tabber>It's about Faith.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm doing this for Faith. Because she and Lily dead, and someone is gonna answer for that.<br />

''The Crooked Man will remember that.''<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' Then why are you here? You know who murdered them.

|-|It's about justice.=

'''Bigby:''' This is about justice. I'm the sheriff... I have to do what's right. Two people were murdered.<br />

''The Crooked Man will remember that.''<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' And you know who did it.

|-|It's about Fabletown.=

'''Bigby:''' This is about protecting Fabletown. When some asshole murders two of our people, it's my job to bring him down.<br />

''The Crooked Man will remember that.''<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' Then why are you here? You know who murdered them.

|-|...=

'''Crooked Man:''' You're smart. I'll admit that. So what I just don't understand... Is why you're here. I mean, you want to catch your killer, right?

</tabber>

'''Crooked Man:''' Georgie. He's dead, isn't he? My point being: the killer has been dealt with. You've won.

'''Bigby:''' You really think I'm that stupid?

'''Crooked Man:''' I understand you have an obligation to bring me in, but you can brighten up a little. It's over. So...shall we get going? I'd rather not dawdle. You know, I'm actually looking forward to seeing Miss White again. My previous interactions with her have gone rather well.

<tabber>Ok, let's go.=

'''Bigby:''' Alright, let's go. Hand over the gun.<br />

''You agreed to the Crooked Man's terms.''<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' I think I'd rather hold onto it, if you don't mind. What do you say?

'''Crooked Man:''' How unfortunate... I was hoping we could make this work.<br />

Bigby knocks the gun out of his hands and slams him against the window.<br />

'''Crooked Man:''' What are you going to do now? Rip me apart like some kind of animal? Killing me here would achieve nothing. And what would Miss White think? You show up with nothing but a corpse... No answers, no proof... You'll never know the truth. And she'll barely stand to look at you. Is it worth it?

'''Beast:''' It wasn't her fault.

'''Greenleaf:''' You can lie to yourself but you can't lie to me. You hated Crane...and you hated him for wanting to fuck you and you being too soft to notice what he'd do to get it. It had nothing to do with the Crooked Man.

'''Snow:''' We've made some mistakes. I've made some mistakes. But believe me... I truly want what's best for this town. And that may not always be clear... right away. But I want you all to know that I care deeply about all of you. And so does the sheriff.

'''Gren:''' Yeah, right.

'''Snow:''' I can't promise you perfection. No one can. But I can promise to always have your best interests at heart.

The crowd walks over to stand with Snow and Bigby.

'''Crooked Man:''' ''(slow claps)'' Very good, very good, the sentiment is surely appreciated, Miss White... but it doesn't disguise the fact that these accusations are completely unfounded. The Sheriff simply doesn't have a particle of evidence linking me to the murders.

'''Snow:''' Georgie was working for you! Bigby got a confession that--

'''Crooked Man:''' A "confession" that nobody heard! Now, I'm no barrister, but I'd think such a statement would carry more weight if Bigby weren't the only one to whom Georgie spoke. Especially given Bigby's... history.

Bigby opens the box, which contains a pinned beetle and a carving saying, "To: Miss White - From: TJ".<br />

'''TJ:''' It's a Willow Beetle. That's a big one. They're cool, 'cause when they're little they have these pouches that squirt juice at you if you touch 'em.

{{#tag:tabber|That's nice.=

'''Bigby:''' That's... interesting, TJ. You sure you want to give this to her?<br />

Fly returns.<br />

'''Flycatcher:''' We're about ready to head out.

|-|(Sent Colin to Farm)=

Colin jumps in the truck, and Fly closes the door.<br />

'''Flycatcher:''' That's everybody.

</tabber>

'''TJ:''' What's it like at the Farm? I've heard ogres live there. And they eat people in their sleep sometimes.

'''Toad:''' God, I hope not.

'''TJ:''' Do we have to go? I wanna stay here.

'''Toad:''' Well, we don't have a choice anymore.

<tabber>I'm sorry.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm sorry, TJ. But look on the bright side, okay? There's plenty of space to run around, and a nice river nearby so you can swim all you want.<br />

''TJ will remember that.''<br />

'''TJ:''' Even in daytime?<br />

'''Bigby:''' Yeah. You don't have to worry about the Mundies seeing you. It'll be nice.

|-|You'll be safer there.=

'''Bigby:''' Don't worry. You'll be a lot safer there. There's plenty of space to run around, and a nice river nearby so you can swim all you want.<br />

''TJ will remember that.''<br />

'''TJ:''' Even in daytime?<br />

'''Bigby:''' Yeah. You don't have to worry about the Mundies seeing you. It'll be nice.

'''Bigby:''' Your dad broke the rules, TJ. You're not allowed to stay in Fabletown without a glamour.<br />

''TJ will remember that.''<br />

'''TJ:''' Okay...

Bigby says nothing.

'''Bigby:''' Come on... it won't be so bad.

'''TJ:''' Have you been there before?

'''Bigby:''' No... I'm, uh-- some of the animals aren't comfortable around wolves.

'''Toad:''' So you wouldn't know, would you?

'''Flycatcher:''' We're all set.

'''TJ:''' Bye, Mr. Wolf.

'''Bigby:''' Goodbye, TJ.

Bigby starts smoking.

{{!}}-{{!}}I wish I could visit.=

'''Bigby:''' I... wish I could come visit you. Up at the Farm.<br />

'''Colin:''' Yeah, well... too bad everyone up there hates you. Maybe if you do bad enough here they'll ban you from Fabletown too. Then we can go on the run together. You can show me around the Carpathians or something.

Bigby says nothing.

Flycatcher gets in the truck and drives away.

'''Nerissa:''' Saying goodbye?

Bigby walks over to Nerissa, who is standing on the other side of the street.

==Sidewalk==

'''Bigby:''' Hi.

'''Nerissa:''' Hi.

'''Bigby:''' You're still wearing that thing?

'''Nerissa:''' Oh... yeah. I guess I am... It's not easy to forget. I know it seems like I should be able to... It's just...

<tabber>You need to let it go.=

'''Bigby:''' You need to let that go. How are you gonna move on if you--<br />

'''Nerissa:''' Bigby, I-- I know you're trying to help, but this is just something I need to do on my own. Okay?

|-|I understand.=

'''Bigby:''' It's okay. I get it.

|-|[Remove ribbon]=

'''Bigby:''' Let me help you...<br />

'''Nerissa:''' Bigby, I-- I know you're trying to help, but this is just something I need to do on my own. Okay?

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Nerissa:''' Listen, I... I came here because... I have to tell you something.

'''Bigby:''' What is it?

'''Nerissa:''' It's about what happened to Faith and Lily. I'm not sure where to start... Faith, Lily and I, we had this plan. We were gonna find a way out. Leave the Pudding 'N Pie for good... But then Faith decided to get some... leverage. She stole a picture of Crane and Lily together. The minute Faith stole that photo, we had dirt on one of the Crooked Man's allies. If he found out--! I-- I had no choice. You have to understand. You've seen how they kept us quiet at that place. Can you imagine the lengths they'd go to just to silence someone who had physical evidence? I had to...

<tabber>What did you do?=

'''Bigby:''' Nerissa, what did you do?

|-|Just tell me.=

'''Bigby:''' Nerissa, just tell me what happened.

|-|It's okay.=

'''Bigby:''' It's okay. Just calm down.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Nerissa:''' I freaked out. Okay? I thought if I came clean to Georgie, he'd get the Crooked Man to leave us alone! We could just forget the whole thing... maybe try again in a few years.

'''Bigby:''' You... what?

'''Nerissa:''' So I told him... everything. And I begged for mercy. For all of us! I didn't want anyone to die over a picture!

<tabber>You sold out your friends?=

'''Bigby:''' So you sold them out?<br />

'''Nerissa:''' No! Yes.

|-|Georgie didn't do mercy.=

'''Bigby:''' Georgie didn't do mercy. You know that.<br />

'''Nerissa:''' He could've been reasoned with! I was counting on that.

|-|You were trying to protect them.=

'''Bigby:''' You were just trying to protect them.<br />

'''Nerissa:''' Yeah...

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Nerissa:''' Georgie promised he'd smooth things over with the Crooked Man. But then... Oh, god... ''(starts crying)''

<tabber>[Touch her arm]=

Bigby reaches towards Nerissa.<br />

''Nerissa noticed that.''

|-|Tell me more.=

'''Bigby:''' What happened... can you tell me anything else?

|-|[Give her a cigarette]=

'''Bigby:''' Here.<br />

Bigby gives Nerissa a cigarette and lights it.<br />

''Nerissa appreciates that.''<br />

'''Nerissa:''' Thank you.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Nerissa:''' I don't know what happened, but that night, at the club... Georgie came back and told me things had changed. He had to make an example of us... we had committed treason. And while the two of us were sitting there... as he was telling me this.. Faith walked in. And I had to watch while Georgie--

<tabber>(Killed Crooked Man)=

'''Nerissa:''' It was my fault. I sold them out. And she just...

{{#tag:tabber|What about Lily?=

'''Bigby:''' And Lily?

{{!}}-{{!}}Holy shit.=

{{!}}-{{!}}I'm so sorry.=

|-|(Didn't kill Crooked Man)=

'''Bigby:''' Wait, so Georgie told you all this? Not the Crooked Man? Back at the Well, you said...<br />

'''Nerissa:''' I know what I said.<br />

'''Bigby:''' But it wasn't the truth, was it?<br />

'''Nerissa:''' What does it matter? I know the Crooked Man did it. So what if it wasn't the whole truth? It was true enough.

{{#tag:tabber|What's done is done.=

'''Bigby:''' I guess... What's done is done.

{{!}}-{{!}}You shouldn't have lied.=

'''Bigby:''' So you think that makes it okay to lie?

{{!}}-{{!}}It was for the best.=

'''Bigby:''' I guess... I guess it worked out in the end. I can't hold that against you.

{{!}}-{{!}}...=

Bigby says nothing.

}}

'''Nerissa:''' I know he ordered their deaths. I wasn't going to let him get away with it because of a stupid technicality. Especially after--

</tabber>

'''Nerissa:''' That night, after Faith... I tried to warn Lily, but she wasn't with her scheduled appointment. So I did the only thing I could do. I-- I left Faith's head at your doorstep.

'''Bigby:''' You?

'''Nerissa:''' I walked her over here and I left her. Just hoping that maybe, if I couldn't save them... I could at least... save the rest of us.

<tabber>That piece of fabric...=

(If Bigby found the fabric.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' So that piece of fabric I found near there... that was you?<br />

'''Nerissa:''' Yeah... I cut my leg trying to get over the fence.

|-|That ring in her mouth...=

(If Bigby didn't find the fabric.)<br />

'''Bigby:''' So that ring in her mouth... that was you?<br />

'''Nerissa:''' Yeah... I couldn't think of any other way to get your attention.

|-|So I would notice...=

'''Bigby:''' You were trying to get my attention.

|-|Why?=

'''Bigby:''' Why would you do that?<br />

'''Nerissa:''' I couldn't think of any other way to get your attention.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Bigby:''' So you... you started all this?

'''Nerissa:''' I just... pointed you in the right direction. People like us get forgotten all the time. The Crooked Man was counting on that. When we suffer, we do it in silence. And the world likes it that way. We just... fade. Like we never existed. I couldn't watch that happen to Faith. Or Lily. Nobody cares about us. Not really.

<tabber>I'm sorry you had to do that.=

'''Bigby:''' I'm sorry, Nerissa. I'm sorry that's what it took to get me to pay attention.<br />

'''Nerissa:''' It'll be different now.

|-|That won't happen anymore.=

'''Bigby:''' It's going to be different now. I promise... things like that won't happen anymore. Not while I'm around.

|-|That's not true.=

'''Bigby:''' That's not true...<br />

'''Nerissa:''' It is. You've just never seen it before. But now you have.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

'''Nerissa:''' You'll make things right... you and Snow.

'''Bigby:''' I don't know... It seems like no matter what I do, it's just... not enough for her. Or anyone. I just can't win with these people.

'''Nerissa:''' I know it might feel that way, but... they need you, Bigby. Both of you. You two make a good team. The way you look out for each other... And look out for us. You don't see that a lot these days.

<tabber>Snow doesn't need me.=

'''Bigby:''' Snow doesn't really need me.<br />

'''Nerissa:''' I'm sure that's not true.

|-|I don't know where we stand.=

'''Bigby:''' I don't really know where we stand anymore. Things are just... different.<br />

'''Nerissa:''' Things are always different. Look, Bigby...

|-|No one's ever fucking happy.=

'''Bigby:''' I just-- I got out there and I do my job... I put my life on the line, I get shot at... I do what has to be done for them. But at the end of the day, I'm still the bad guy.<br />

'''Nerissa:''' I know... but they'll come around. You'll see...

|-|...=

'''Nerissa:''' Look, Bigby...

</tabber>

'''Nerissa:''' After everything you've done for us-- Maybe they don't want to admit it, but... without you, none of this would have happened. You listened... when no one else would.

<tabber>(Was violent)=

'''Nerissa:''' You protected your friends... no matter the cost.

|-|(Was peaceful)=

'''Nerissa:''' You knew when to show mercy...

</tabber>

'''Nerissa:''' And you brought justice to this town... finally.

<tabber>(Killed Crooked Man in foundry)=

'''Nerissa:''' If you hadn't killed the Crooked Man back there, he would've just talked his way out of it like he always does.

|-|(Didn't kill Crooked Man in foundry)=

'''Nerissa:''' Because you brought the Crooked Man in, everyone saw who he really was.

</tabber>

'''Nerissa:''' So from where I'm standing... you did the right thing. You've been given this job for a reason. And I left Faith at your doorstep, because I knew... if anyone stood a chance against the Crooked man, it was you.

<tabber>I've made a lot of mistakes.=

'''Bigby:''' I've... been making a lot of mistakes lately.<br />

'''Nerissa:''' But you've also done a lot of good. Don't forget that.

|-|I hope I've done some good.=

'''Bigby:''' I hope I've at least done some good here.

|-|None of it matters in the end.=

'''Bigby:''' No... it doesn't matter what I do. In the end, it's all the same shit it always was.<br />

'''Nerissa:''' You're wrong.

|-|...=

Bigby says nothing.

</tabber>

''Nerissa will remember that.''

'''Nerissa:''' You've changed this place. For better or worse... Fabletown wouldn't be the same without you.

Nerissa starts to walk away, then stops and turns back.

'''Nerissa:''' You're not as bad as everyone says you are.

Nerissa continues walking away.

'''Faith:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' I need to tell you something.

'''Nerissa:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' I have to tell you something.

'''Bigby:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' I feel like we've met before.

'''Nerissa:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' You're trying to place me.

'''Faith:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' You like my ribbon?

'''Nerissa:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' Do you like it?

'''Bigby:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' Faith wore one too.

'''Bufkin:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' Would hide her beauty, so she could escape his kingdom.

'''Nerissa:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' They used to call me The Little Mermaid.

'''Bigby:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' Did Dr. Swineheart ever get back to you about Faith?

'''Snow:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' He said he wanted to run more tests.

'''Nerissa:''' ''(in Bigby's memory)'' I hope you find what you're looking for.

Bigby starts walking toward her.
