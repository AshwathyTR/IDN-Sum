== '''Prologue''' ==

''[[Chloe Price (Prequel)|Chloe Price]], standing on train tracks and wearing a black hoodie, flicks her lighter a few times and lights up her cigarette. She takes a deep breath, then takes the cigarette out of her mouth and breathes out the smoke. A train begins to approach her. Chloe takes another couple hits from her cigarette before letting it fall in between the tracks. She jumps out of the way of the train at the last second, watching it go by, then takes off her hood and looks at the [[Old Mill|sawmill]] across from her.''

'''Chloe:''' ''(thinking)'' I can't believe [[Firewalk]] is playing a show at the old mill. Fuck yes! [[Joyce Price (Prequel)|Mom]] would kill me if she knew I was out here.

''Chloe gets a running start and jumps over the fence, then turns to give it a double middle finger. She then walks down toward the mill.''

'''Man 2:''' But...i—it really wasn't my fault.

'''Man 1:''' You're always blaming everyone else but yourself.

'''Chloe:''' ''(thinking)'' Those guys need to get a room.

''Man 1 shoves Man 2 and threateningly gestures and points toward him as Man 2 cowers with his hands up. Man 1 then slaps Man 2.''

'''Chloe:''' ''(thinking)'' Or not. Damn.

'''Man 1:''' ''(to Chloe)'' Mind your own business.

'''<u>Second Argument Between the Two Men</u>'''

'''Man 2:''' I understand, I understand, really, an—and it won't ever happen again, I swear! You can trust me, I promise. I really get it now, I—I do.

''The bouncer throws her ID on the ground. Chloe picks it up and walks away from him.''

'''Chloe:''' ''(thinking)'' Can't let him push me around. Should I go back and stand up to him? Or can something around here help me convince him?

'''Mikey:''' I cast Ergel's Acid Blast.

'''Steph:''' Um, overkill?

'''Mikey:''' Bam!

'''Steph:''' You conjure up a wave of acid that washes over the charging orcs. Every raider suddenly starts screaming and writhing in pain. There's a sweet and sour kind of smell as the flesh melts off their bones like warm candle wax.

== '''Principal Wells' Office''' ==
''[[Raymond Wells (Prequel)|Principal Wells]], [[Rachel Amber (Prequel)|Rachel Amber]], [[Rose Amber]] and [[James Amber]] are all waiting in Principal Wells office. [[Chloe Price (Prequel)|Chloe Price]] and [[Joyce Price (Prequel)|Joyce Price]] enter the office.''

'''Principal Wells:''' Ms. Price. How good of you to join us.

'''Joyce:''' I'm so sorry we're late. My—my shift ran late at the diner and then...just, sorry.

'''Principal Wells:''' Let us proceed. One of you here is new to the [[Blackwell Academy|Blackwell]] disciplinary process... And the other is all too familiar with it. Blackwell's code of conduct is built upon a foundation of mutual respect meant to foster an environment conducive to education and enrichment. When that respect is violated, actions are taken. When that respect is repeatedly disregarded, a more consequential response is required.

'''Chloe:''' ''(thinking)'' Okay, reality check time. Yesterday did actually happen. I ditched school with Rachel Amber. And then Rachel really did start that fire. And that was after we actually agreed to run away from here...right?

'''Principal Wells:''' Are you paying attention to me, Chloe?

'''Chloe:''' Um...what?

'''Principal Wells:''' Ms. Price, the last time we met, an agreement was brokered. Do you recall what that was?

'''Chloe:''' What?

"I've been down that road," she told me. "You're better than this." But I wouldn't listen. See, Chloe was afraid I'd get in trouble or hurt, so she came with me. But only to keep me safe.

'''Principal Wells:''' Ms. Price, Ms. Amber: one of you girls better start telling me what actually happened. Now.

'''Chloe:''' It's fine. Really.

'''Rachel:''' You're right. The truth is, I didn't convince Chloe to ditch with me I practically forced her to.

'''Chloe:''' Oh, come on...

'''Rachel:''' I was feeling angsty and reckless. Tired of living up to the perfect image everybody expects out of me. I told Chloe, if she didn't come with me, I might do something crazy.

'''Rose:''' Like what?

'''Rachel:''' Graffiti. Steal alcohol. Maybe even...abuse marijuana.

''Rose and James look at each other, shocked.''

'''Rachel:''' I didn't, thank god. But that's only because Chloe was there. She looked out for me, even after I threatened her. I told her I would blame her for everything if she didn't come along. I knew it would be easy, given all of the prejudices against her.

'''Principal Wells:''' Uh. Now...

'''Chloe:''' This is some serious—

''Rachel cuts Chloe off.''

'''Rachel:''' "Chloe," I told her. "If you get blamed for this, you will be in serious trouble. Serious. Trouble. Whereas I, having a perfect record at Blackwell, will not. Think about it," I told her. "And don't do anything you'll regret." Anyway, that's what really happened.

Chloe walks up to a rusty old truck she is about to hit with a baseball bat, until she realizes that she might be able to fix it. Chloe opens up the hood to the truck and looks at the inside of it in disgust.''

'''Chloe:''' Ugh.

''Chloe pulls the battery out of the truck and throws it on the ground.''

''Chloe can attempt to climb to the top of a rusty boat but will fail after trying for a bit.''

''Chloe maneuvers her way around to the front of the boat to climb to the top. She proceeds to sit there and look at the forest fire.''

'''Chloe:''' ''(thinking)'' I can't believe Rachel set that fire. I don't think she meant to. But I also don't think she...didn't mean to. Crazy that something so destructive can also be so beautiful. Or a fire that began in a trash can could grow to light up the entire sky. In conclusion, fire: pretty sweet.

''Chloe returns to the old rusty truck and puts the new battery in to it. Chloe gets zapped while attempting to connect the battery. Chloe closes the hood and gets inside the truck. Chloe begins looking around for keys, but notices a screwdriver and uses it to try to start the truck, with no success.''

'''Chloe:''' Damn. This thing needs more love than I can give right now.

''Chloe exits the truck.''

'''Chloe:''' In the meantime, maybe I can spruce it up a bit?

''Chloe looks around the truck seeing how she can improve it. She notices that the truck needs a seat cover, something to cover the hole in the passenger side floor and a light bulb for the ceiling light. Chloe exits the truck.''

'''Chloe:''' ''(thinking)'' Okay, let's see what else this trash heap has to offer.

''Chloe proceeds to look around the junkyard for the items she needs to spruce up the truck. For the ceiling light, she can take a blue lightbulb from the robot, a red one from the used car, or a green one from the Christmas lights. Chloe can choose from the pirate flag or the rainbow beach towel for the seat cover. Chloe can choose from the welcome mat, the old rug, or the putting green to cover the hole in the floor of the truck. She can also put a bobblehead Elvis on the dashboard.''

''After Chloe is done fixing up the truck, she proceeds to enter the truck.''

'''Chloe:''' ''(thinking)'' This thing looks like a rusted-out shopping cart. Probably drives like one too. That's if it ever does drive, which seems questionable.

''The moment disappears and the next one begins. Sera stands in front of a bed, a needle on the ground next to her and mascara smeared from her tears. Baby Rachel is heard crying in the background.''

'''James:''' ''(voiceover)'' However much she loved you then, ''[sighs]'' it wasn't enough. For Sera, the need to escape was always there.

''Sera reaches down and grabs the needle.''

'''James:''' ''(voiceover)'' For over a year, I tried to help her. I made myself believe that she was still a good person.

''Rachel continues crying, but Sera ignores her, injecting the needle into her arm.''

'''James:''' ''(voiceover)'' That, no matter what happened, ''[sighs]'' ''(voice breaking)'' she would never do anything to hurt you.

''Sera drops the needle and slowly falls to the ground. The baby's cries increase.''

'''James:''' ''(voiceover)'' ''[sighs]'' ''(voice breaking)'' I...was wrong. ''[sighs]'' Eventually, I saw her... ''[inhales]'' for who she really was.

''James runs into the room and begins shaking Sera, but her eyes stay shut and she doesn't move. The baby's cries continue, getting louder and more pained.''

'''James:''' ''(voiceover)'' ''[sniffles]'' A destructive person. ''(voice breaking)'' Someone who could never be satisfied, ''[inhales]'' ''(normally)'' by anyone, or anything.

''James runs over to the crib, worried.''

'''James:''' ''(voiceover)'' ''(voice breaking)'' Even the love of her own daughter.

''James picks up the baby and bounces her, trying to soothe her.''

'''James:''' ''(voiceover)'' ''[inhales]'' ''(breathily)'' I was desperate. ''(sobbing)'' I didn't know what to do, ''[sniffles]'' s—so I made a choice. I was never going to let her harm you again.

''The baby finally calms down. She closes her eyes and makes cooing noises. The scene fades away; the new image is of James and Sera standing under the tree at Overlook Park.''

'''James:''' ''(voiceover)'' ''[inhales]'' ''(voice breaking)'' What you saw at the overlook, Rachel... ''[sighs]'' It was true, we kissed.

''James and Sera kiss.''

'''James:''' ''(voiceover)'' ''[inhales]'' ''(voice breaking)'' It was the saddest kiss of my life. It was a kiss goodbye. I told her ''[inhales]'' that I was happy for her, that she felt like she'd gotten her life together...finally. ''(tearfully)'' But she didn't get to just decide one day to be a mother.

''James expression is sad and pained; he places his hands on Sera's shoulders and talks to her. Sera looks surprised, shaking her head as James speaks. James pulls away but Sera grabs his hands.''

'''James:''' ''(voiceover)'' ''(tearfully)'' ''[sniffles]'' Not after what she'd done. Not after all the people she hurt, ''[sighs]'' all the lives she destroyed. I told her ''[inhales]'' she'd been given the greatest gift in the world...the chance to be your mother.

''James backs away but Sera advances toward him. He turns and leaves.''

'''James:''' ''(voiceover)'' ''[sighs]'' And she squandered it.

''Sera stands alone, looking sad.''

'''James:''' ''(voiceover)'' It...pained me to hurt her like that. ''[inhales]'' But I'd do it again...and again, and again, to keep you safe.

''The scene fades away and Chloe and Rachel are left standing at the viewfinder. Then the viewfinder and the blackness disappear and Chloe and Rachel are again sitting on the couch across from James and Rose.''

'''Rachel:''' ''(accusingly)'' So that was the first time you've seen her or spoken with her in 15 years?

'''James:''' No... ''[looks down sadly]'' I send her money... ''[exchanges pained glance with Rose]'' Every single month. ''[sighs, places hand on Rose's]'' It's our...arrangement.

''Rose sits down in the armchair behind James.''

'''Rachel:''' But now...she wants to see me?

'''James:''' Yes. But Rachel, it cannot be.

<tabber>Why not?=<h5 style="display:none">Why not?</h5><blockquote>

'''Chloe:''' Why not? If that's what Rachel wants?

'''James:''' Drug addiction is a disease. It afflicts everyone, not just the addict. I will not allow you to be victimized by her disease again.

'''Chloe:''' Even if that's true, Rachel could still meet her.

'''Rachel:''' And, maybe...the—the fact that she wants to see me...means she's gotten better?

'''Chloe:''' You think you have the right to decide that for her?

'''Rachel:''' But maybe she's different now. People change, right?

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''James:''' Maybe so. But consider that for 15 years, she's preferred that money to you.

''Rachel looks shocked and lightly sobs.''

'''Chloe:''' Rachel...

'''Rachel:''' I think I need to lie down.

''Everyone gets up. Rachel walks up the stairs to her room and James and Rose watch her with sadness and concern. James sits down in an armchair, his head in his hands. Rose goes into the kitchen, slumping over the sink.''

'''<u>Optional Conversation with James</u>'''

''Chloe sits in the chair across from him.''

'''Chloe:''' Uh...um, this must be hard for you too...Mr. Amber.

'''James:''' ''[sighs]'' It could be far worse. My biggest fear is that Rachel will try to meet Sera. I've dreaded it.

'''Chloe:''' So that's why you never told her?

'''James:''' ''[sighs]'' You have no idea what pain Sera's caused. Her addiction has led her to do terrible things. I don't want Rachel to go through any of that.

<tabber>Shouldn't that be up to Rachel?=<h5 style="display:none">Shouldn't that be up to Rachel?</h5><blockquote>

''Chloe puts the flashlight on the floor and turns off the lamp. She sits on the bed next to Rachel and nudges her.''

''In her dream, Chloe, in her Ariel costume (minus the hat), is sleeping on two chairs on the Tempest stage, with a starry, violet sky above her. William sits on a chair in front of her, with his hands on an invisible steering wheel. One of William's country songs, "Burning the Midnight Oil", plays in the background. Chloe wakes up and sits on one of the chairs. David, Joyce, Wells, Victoria, James, Rose, and the raven are sitting in the audience, most of them with their arms crossed.''

=== Waiting Room ===

''Chloe enters the hospital with tears streaming down her face, supporting Rachel, who is barely conscious. A nurse carries Rachel onto a gurney and another nurse helps her wheel Rachel away. Chloe paces the waiting room for a while, and eventually Rose and James show up. James speaks to Chloe briefly, but Rose holds his hand and pulls him away. Chloe sits in a chair, continuing to wait. Later, a police officer speaks to one of the nurses. Two firefighters show up as well, and one of them speaks to the officer. After a while, James enters the waiting room to speak to Chloe, who is still crying.''

'''Sera:''' Rachel deserves a loving father. A father who cares for her.

'''Chloe:''' James is a liar who—

'''Chloe:''' Why are you saying all this?

'''Sera:''' Because James is right. He’s taken something from me that I might not ever get back...but he’s right. I'm broken.

'''Sera:''' I know.

'''Chloe:''' She's fearless. She's brilliant, and talented, and she feels so much...she's strong.

'''Sera:''' She's had a good life. Raised in a loving home. Given opportunities I could never give her.

'''Chloe:''' At least talk to her. She's felt like something's been missing her whole life, she told me so. That something was you.

'''Sera:''' She didn't miss anything. She has a perfect family.

<tabber>They are far from perfect.=<h5 style="display:none">They are far from perfect.</h5><blockquote>

'''Sera:''' What Rachel needs, though, is not to have her father taken away from her.

'''Chloe:''' He doesn't deserve—

'''Sera:''' It's not about James. It's not about me, and it's not about you. It's about Rachel. Tell her what James did, and you'll be killing him for her. You understand that, don't you?

</tabber>

'''Sera:''' Nothing can change the mistakes I made. I'll never get to be Rachel's mother. Not really. But there's one thing I can still do for her. The only thing I can do.

''Sera gets up.''

'''Sera:''' Let me give her the father she deserves. The one who raised her, protected her. The one who loves her more than anything. You can do whatever you want, Chloe. You have the power. What you have to decide is whether you're going to protect Rachel, or cause her even more hurt. So, please, tell her I was never here. Let her have what peace she can. Without me.

'''Rachel:''' Can I talk to Chloe alone for a minute?

'''Rose:''' Okay, sweetie. We'll be right outside.

'''Rachel:''' No. That's not...that's not true.

'''Rachel:''' No.
