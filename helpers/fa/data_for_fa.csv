[EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Rachel looks awesome...
[EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Rachel looks so happy here...","The episode starts with a hooded Chloe Price smoking a cigarette and standing at the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to come. After its passage, she takes off her hood and goes towards the old mill, ignoring the ""No Trespassing"" sign after jumping over a fence. In order to get inside the mill, she starts an argument with the bouncer, in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails. After entering, she can interact with people, objects, graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money (or not). If she steals the money, she'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later. After this, she'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys, the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her. However, she'll manage to see the band by going upstairs, even with the floor there being rotten. She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her. She's saved by Rachel Amber, in her very first appearance, and will have the first major choice of the game: attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing. After running downstairs, the two girls stop and look at Frank, who notices what's going to happen and quickly stops the guys, causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill. Rachel pulls Chloe along with her, and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night. The next morning, Chloe is shown waking up in her room, at the Price household. She sits up and takes her red 'Oregon' ashtray and starts smoking a cigarette (or weed, if she bought it from Frank earlier with the stolen money). Chloe can look at a photo of her and Max Caulfield as kids along with her dad, William Price and can also look at her diary. After being called by her mother, Joyce Price, for breakfast downstairs, she'll get up from her bed and will be able to interact with many objects around her room. She'll change clothes before leaving her room (the player gets to choose her outfit). Due to having drunk too much, Chloe notices her phone is missing. She then goes to her mother's room to call her phone with her mother's phone. There, she can interact with another object before using her mother's phone. By doing this, Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom, and just after she takes it, her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone, causing her to go back to the room. When she finally goes downstairs, she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on. She'll then talk with her mother about several topics, and at the end of the conversation, she'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels. Depending on her choice, Joyce will be either kind or tough towards her. Chloe'll have to pick the keys from her stepfather, David Madsen, and take them to him since he'll be taking her to school today. After leaving the house and going to David, he'll ask her to get the tools he needs to fix his car in the garage. After this, she gets in the car and David will try to start a conversation with her. She can either start a fight with him or listen to what he has to say. After the talk, Chloe will fall asleep and have a weird dream about being in a car with her dad, going to pick up her mom from the grocery store. The dream abruptly ends with a truck crashing through William's car. When she wakes up, she's already at Blackwell Academy. There, she can talk to Eliot Hampden (and choose whether or not she wants to watch The Tempest play with him), Victoria Chase (with the option of sabotaging her homework if doing so), Skip Matthews (with the option of listening to the demo of his band, PissHead, and giving him your opinion on it if doing so), Principal Wells (only if she sits on a crate on the stage and with the option of starting a backtalk challenge with him if doing so), Michelle Grant, Mikey North and Steph Gingrich (in order to get her DVD and with the additional option of playing a tabletop game with them), and other students. Afterwards, she'll go towards the school entrance, but she'll be interrupted by Drew North and Nathan Prescott, who are starting a fight. A student called Samantha Myers urges Chloe to do something to help Nathan, and Chloe can either backtalk Drew and defend Nathan or just ignore them, which will cause Samantha to either thank Chloe or be upset with her for not helping. When the fight is over, she can finally enter the school, and just as she opens the door, Rachel appears on the other side and pulls her along with her to the Drama Lab where Travis Keaton is rehearsing with Dana Ward and Hayden Jones. Rachel will ask for her opinion on Miranda's love for Fernando, both portrayed by Dana and Hayden respectively in ""The Tempest"" play, and Chloe can choose whether to say it's true love or not. After the class is over, everyone will leave the room, except for Chloe and Rachel. Rachel will change to normal clothes and ask Chloe to get her belt from her bag and bring it to her. After doing this, they'll have a short conversation before Rachel invites Chloe to skip school, and they end up in a train carriage where, after finding some crates to sit on, they play the game Two Truths and a Lie. Chloe can either cheat or follow the game rules. After their game, Chloe will have the option of sharing or not her earbuds with Rachel during their trip. Upon arriving at Overlook Park, they'll play another game using the viewfinders to spy on people around the park. However, the viewfinder that they intend to use it broken. Chloe asks Rachel for something sharp like a knife and she gives her a nail file, which Chloe uses to unscrew a deducation plate from a park bench and then uses it to break open the viewfinder, allowing them to use it for free. When they get a closer view of the last couple available, a man and a woman under a tree, Rachel gets distressed when they start kissing and puts an end to their game, telling Chloe she needs to get drunk. They'll then go to the other side of the park, where a couple is having a picnic and have a bottle of wine on their table. Rachel approaches the couple and starts acting sick, throwing herself to the ground and pretending to be in need of resuscitation. Chloe can encourage the man to help her, either succeeding or failing on doing so resulting in the man ""saving"" Rachel's life or the woman seeing through their ploy. Whatever the outcome is, the two girls will get the wine. After this, they're shown walking on the train tracks. Chloe invites Rachel to explore a junkyard nearby and Rachel lets her explore on her own. After a long conversation between the two, no matter what choices the player has made so far, Rachel will leave, but not before Chloe tries to convince her to stay. Chloe has the option to say that they have a real friendship or something more. Once Rachel leaves, Chloe gets angry and breaks everything around her. She then has a meltdown upon seeing her late father's car. She'll fall asleep and have another dream about her father, this time, with him advising/warning her on her relationship with Rachel, in which Chloe will see Rachel outside of the car, who will then catch fire. When she wakes up, it's already night and she goes back to the overlook where she finds Rachel. Upon a brief dialogue, in which Rachel reveals the man they had seen at the park was her dad, and that he was cheating on her mother with that woman. Rachel takes out a photo of her as a kid with her father, asks Chloe for her lighter which she uses it burn the photo, throwing it into a nearby trash bin, and starting a wildfire by kicking the bin into a tree nearby. Rachel then screams, increasing the fire's intensity. The episode ends showing each character's reaction to the wildfire seen in the sky.

[EX]   S0 : CHOICE: (Said Rachel was more than a friend)  [EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Guess I need those.","Episode 2: Brave New World begins with Rachel Amber and Chloe Price in Principal Wells' office. Both Rachel and Chloe are questioned about their absence the day before. The conversation varies depending on how Chloe treated Joyce, if she sabotaged Victoria's homework, if she went onstage and smoked weed, whether she helped Nathan or not, and if she won or lost the backtalk against Drew (if she helped Nathan). Rachel claims their misbehavior was her idea, and as punishment, is removed as Wells' administrative assistant and her role as Prospera in The Tempest. If Chloe goes along with Rachel, she will be suspended. If Chloe takes the blame for Rachel, she will be expelled, but Rachel won't be removed from the play. After they leave the office, Skip Matthews escorts Chloe to her locker, so she can clean it out. Chloe searches for her hidden joint but discovers Justin Williams has taken it. Angry, Chloe lies to Skip that she has to use the bathroom. Meanwhile, Joyce speaks with Rachel's parents, James, and Rose Amber. Once inside, she proceeds to tag it from ceiling to floor, venting her frustration. She then exits and Victoria approaches the bathroom, looking dumbfounded as she opens the door. Chloe enters the parking lot of Blackwell Academy. She can optionally talk to Eliot, who will feel sympathy for her expulsion or suspension and offer her a hug. He will again ask her if she wants to go to the play with him. Chloe walks to the car where Joyce and David are waiting for her; David asks her to empty her pockets on the hood of the car. David later announces that he will be moving in with them. This outrages Chloe and she storms off. David stops Joyce from going after her, wanting to give her some time to get over her anger. Chloe goes to the junkyard and knocks over items with her bat until she notices a very old truck. She scours the junkyard for various items needed to fix the truck: a battery from an impounded truck (which requires having to press a button to unlock the hood); something to cover the hole in the floor: a rug, a welcome mat, or a golf mat; a new light bulb from either a fish tank, a toy robot, or a Christmas wreath; and something to cover the torn seat: a pirate flag or a beach towel. She can also optionally decorate the truck using an Elvis Presley bobblehead found in a small box somewhere in the junkyard and draw a decoration on the back of the seat. Despite all her hard work, the truck still remains inoperational. She then relaxes in the driver's seat and smokes a cigarette. Chloe finds herself in another one of her dreams. She finds William, her deceased father, roasting marshmallows in the burning wreckage of his car. She sits next to him and roasts marshmallows too, as he warns her about the danger of fire, a metaphor for Rachel Amber. The dream ends with William's face being shown half-burnt with a raven pecking at his face. Chloe wakes up to find Rachel tapping on the window of her car, carrying a duffel bag. Rachel gets inside the car and the two have a ""therapy session"" (which will vary depending on if Rachel was removed from the play or not): they discuss their feelings about the current events in their life and how unhappy they are with them. Rachel leaves and gives Chloe her duffel bag, which is full of clothes. Chloe receives a call from Frank Bowers, who wants to meet up with her. Chloe enters the Hideout in the junkyard. She can optionally spruce up the place and then changes into one of Rachel's outfits. Frank approaches in his RV. Chloe sees a woman leaving the vehicle. She enters Frank's RV and he drives away. He asks her to retrieve his account book. Chloe opens the door to his bedroom, and Pompidou runs out. She takes his account book and brings it to him. Chloe then asks Frank about the woman, but he refuses to say anything. Frank reveals that Drew North runs Oxy for Damon Merrick and he owes him $1,000. He asks her to go to the school to find the money and bring it to him. After Frank drops off Chloe, she can speak with Steph Gingrich, Evan Harris, and Samuel Taylor. She shoos away a bird that Evan is photographing to distract him long enough for Chloe to damage a nearby sprinkler. This gets Samuel's attention and while he goes to fix the sprinkler, Chloe takes his keys and uses it to unlock the dorm, but encounters Skip. An argument begins, which will earn either Skip's trust or anger before he leaves to deal with an unauthorized vehicle in the parking lot (presumably Frank's RV). After she enters Drew and Mikey's room, she must figure out the combination to a locked trunk containing the money. If she fails too many times, she will get help from Steph. After getting the money, she is caught by Mikey and Drew (who are preparing to leave), followed by the arrival of Damon. Drew goes out to talk to him while telling Chloe not to leave the room. Upon hearing Damon beat up Drew, Chloe must choose whether to intervene or stay in the room, which will lead Drew to be glad for staying out of the way or upset for interfering. If she stays out of the fight, Drew will get injured and after Damon leaves, Chloe must choose to give the money to Drew or keep it. If she intervenes, Mikey will get hurt instead and Chloe will hand the money over to Damon, who then leaves. It is now late afternoon and Blackwell begins to start the play. Chloe can find Samantha Myers overhearing Nathan Prescott talking with his father, who wants his son to get over his fear and not humiliate him. Chloe can choose whether to talk to him or keep quiet. She can then convince Samantha to cheer for Nathan and can also encourage Nathan, be sarcastic towards him, or do nothing. Afterwards, she can talk to Hayden Jones, Dana Ward, and Travis Keaton and has the option of playing with the spotlights. In the changing room, Chloe will face a situation between Rachel and Victoria which varies depending on if Rachel was dropped from the play or not. If Rachel was removed from the play, this will lead to either Chloe getting Victoria to drop from the play via backtalk or Rachel drugging Victoria's tea if Chloe was nice to Victoria or lost the backtalk. If Rachel wasn't removed, Victoria will drug Rachel's tea instead. Chloe can either warn Rachel or distract Victoria. If she warns Rachel, she will get Victoria to drink the drugged tea by pretending to believe her. If Chloe distracts Victoria, she will temporally leave and Chloe will switch the cups, leading Victoria to drink the drugged tea upon returning. Keaton later informs the students that Juliet Watson, who was meant to play as Ariel, is delayed by the wildfire that Rachel caused and can't make it in time. Following this, Victoria will then either drop from the play (in which Rachel will then volunteer to take over for Victoria) or fall unconscious. Rachel then convinces a reluctant Chloe to take over for Juliet. As Chloe and Rachel perform onstage as Prospera and Ariel, Nathan then comes in, who will either leave in embarrassment or have confidence and play out his role. Juliet later arrives and replaces Chloe's spot in the play. At the end of the play, Rachel, Hayden, Dana, Juliet, Keaton, and Nathan all come out and bow to the audience, with Rachel bringing Chloe out to join the other performers. The mysterious woman from earlier is seen watching them from a distance. Rachel and Chloe are next seen wandering down a street together. Rachel is happy about the play and how Chloe took part in it. The two then discuss their plan to leave Arcadia Bay, in which Chloe can either receive Rachel's bracelet, a promise for a tattoo, or a kiss. After the conversation, they then head to Rachel's house to pick up clothes. Rachel and Chloe attempt to sneak upstairs but are caught by James. When James compliments her performance, her mood changes, and she despondently replies ""thanks"". Rachel heads upstairs to freshen up, leaving Chloe with her parents. Chloe then helps Rose set up plates and cups for the dinner table, question James of what he wants to drink (in which he will ask for Sherry), and light the candles on the table with her lighter. The four all sit down for dinner and Rachel's parents begin talking about the forest fire and the reports that it was arson. The conversation soon turns into an argument when Rachel's anger visibly increases throughout James's lecture. Chloe can either calm Rachel down or attack James on his misdeeds with her backtalk. Whichever option is chosen, Rachel will lose her temper and call James out. When Chloe and Rose join in the argument, Rachel begins to dissociate and eventually throws a salad bowl through the table, smashing it. She screams at James to tell her the truth.

[EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Rachel looks awesome...","The episode starts with a hooded Chloe Price smoking a cigarette and standing at the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to come. After its passage, she takes off her hood and goes towards the old mill, ignoring the ""No Trespassing"" sign after jumping over a fence. In order to get inside the mill, she starts an argument with the bouncer, in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails. After entering, she can interact with people, objects, graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money (or not). If she steals the money, she'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later. After this, she'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys, the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her. However, she'll manage to see the band by going upstairs, even with the floor there being rotten. She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her. She's saved by Rachel Amber, in her very first appearance, and will have the first major choice of the game: attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing. After running downstairs, the two girls stop and look at Frank, who notices what's going to happen and quickly stops the guys, causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill. Rachel pulls Chloe along with her, and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night. The next morning, Chloe is shown waking up in her room, at the Price household. She sits up and takes her red 'Oregon' ashtray and starts smoking a cigarette (or weed, if she bought it from Frank earlier with the stolen money). Chloe can look at a photo of her and Max Caulfield as kids along with her dad, William Price and can also look at her diary. After being called by her mother, Joyce Price, for breakfast downstairs, she'll get up from her bed and will be able to interact with many objects around her room. She'll change clothes before leaving her room (the player gets to choose her outfit). Due to having drunk too much, Chloe notices her phone is missing. She then goes to her mother's room to call her phone with her mother's phone. There, she can interact with another object before using her mother's phone. By doing this, Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom, and just after she takes it, her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone, causing her to go back to the room. When she finally goes downstairs, she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on. She'll then talk with her mother about several topics, and at the end of the conversation, she'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels. Depending on her choice, Joyce will be either kind or tough towards her. Chloe'll have to pick the keys from her stepfather, David Madsen, and take them to him since he'll be taking her to school today. After leaving the house and going to David, he'll ask her to get the tools he needs to fix his car in the garage. After this, she gets in the car and David will try to start a conversation with her. She can either start a fight with him or listen to what he has to say. After the talk, Chloe will fall asleep and have a weird dream about being in a car with her dad, going to pick up her mom from the grocery store. The dream abruptly ends with a truck crashing through William's car. When she wakes up, she's already at Blackwell Academy. There, she can talk to Eliot Hampden (and choose whether or not she wants to watch The Tempest play with him), Victoria Chase (with the option of sabotaging her homework if doing so), Skip Matthews (with the option of listening to the demo of his band, PissHead, and giving him your opinion on it if doing so), Principal Wells (only if she sits on a crate on the stage and with the option of starting a backtalk challenge with him if doing so), Michelle Grant, Mikey North and Steph Gingrich (in order to get her DVD and with the additional option of playing a tabletop game with them), and other students. Afterwards, she'll go towards the school entrance, but she'll be interrupted by Drew North and Nathan Prescott, who are starting a fight. A student called Samantha Myers urges Chloe to do something to help Nathan, and Chloe can either backtalk Drew and defend Nathan or just ignore them, which will cause Samantha to either thank Chloe or be upset with her for not helping. When the fight is over, she can finally enter the school, and just as she opens the door, Rachel appears on the other side and pulls her along with her to the Drama Lab where Travis Keaton is rehearsing with Dana Ward and Hayden Jones. Rachel will ask for her opinion on Miranda's love for Fernando, both portrayed by Dana and Hayden respectively in ""The Tempest"" play, and Chloe can choose whether to say it's true love or not. After the class is over, everyone will leave the room, except for Chloe and Rachel. Rachel will change to normal clothes and ask Chloe to get her belt from her bag and bring it to her. After doing this, they'll have a short conversation before Rachel invites Chloe to skip school, and they end up in a train carriage where, after finding some crates to sit on, they play the game Two Truths and a Lie. Chloe can either cheat or follow the game rules. After their game, Chloe will have the option of sharing or not her earbuds with Rachel during their trip. Upon arriving at Overlook Park, they'll play another game using the viewfinders to spy on people around the park. However, the viewfinder that they intend to use it broken. Chloe asks Rachel for something sharp like a knife and she gives her a nail file, which Chloe uses to unscrew a deducation plate from a park bench and then uses it to break open the viewfinder, allowing them to use it for free. When they get a closer view of the last couple available, a man and a woman under a tree, Rachel gets distressed when they start kissing and puts an end to their game, telling Chloe she needs to get drunk. They'll then go to the other side of the park, where a couple is having a picnic and have a bottle of wine on their table. Rachel approaches the couple and starts acting sick, throwing herself to the ground and pretending to be in need of resuscitation. Chloe can encourage the man to help her, either succeeding or failing on doing so resulting in the man ""saving"" Rachel's life or the woman seeing through their ploy. Whatever the outcome is, the two girls will get the wine. After this, they're shown walking on the train tracks. Chloe invites Rachel to explore a junkyard nearby and Rachel lets her explore on her own. After a long conversation between the two, no matter what choices the player has made so far, Rachel will leave, but not before Chloe tries to convince her to stay. Chloe has the option to say that they have a real friendship or something more. Once Rachel leaves, Chloe gets angry and breaks everything around her. She then has a meltdown upon seeing her late father's car. She'll fall asleep and have another dream about her father, this time, with him advising/warning her on her relationship with Rachel, in which Chloe will see Rachel outside of the car, who will then catch fire. When she wakes up, it's already night and she goes back to the overlook where she finds Rachel. Upon a brief dialogue, in which Rachel reveals the man they had seen at the park was her dad, and that he was cheating on her mother with that woman. Rachel takes out a photo of her as a kid with her father, asks Chloe for her lighter which she uses it burn the photo, throwing it into a nearby trash bin, and starting a wildfire by kicking the bin into a tree nearby. Rachel then screams, increasing the fire's intensity. The episode ends showing each character's reaction to the wildfire seen in the sky.

[EX]   S0 : CHOICE: (Saw the photo Rachel posted)  [EX]   CHLOE : People can eat a dick.
[EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Rachel looks awesome...","The episode starts with a hooded Chloe Price smoking a cigarette and standing at the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to come. After its passage, she takes off her hood and goes towards the old mill, ignoring the ""No Trespassing"" sign after jumping over a fence. In order to get inside the mill, she starts an argument with the bouncer, in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails. After entering, she can interact with people, objects, graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money (or not). If she steals the money, she'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later. After this, she'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys, the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her. However, she'll manage to see the band by going upstairs, even with the floor there being rotten. She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her. She's saved by Rachel Amber, in her very first appearance, and will have the first major choice of the game: attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing. After running downstairs, the two girls stop and look at Frank, who notices what's going to happen and quickly stops the guys, causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill. Rachel pulls Chloe along with her, and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night. The next morning, Chloe is shown waking up in her room, at the Price household. She sits up and takes her red 'Oregon' ashtray and starts smoking a cigarette (or weed, if she bought it from Frank earlier with the stolen money). Chloe can look at a photo of her and Max Caulfield as kids along with her dad, William Price and can also look at her diary. After being called by her mother, Joyce Price, for breakfast downstairs, she'll get up from her bed and will be able to interact with many objects around her room. She'll change clothes before leaving her room (the player gets to choose her outfit). Due to having drunk too much, Chloe notices her phone is missing. She then goes to her mother's room to call her phone with her mother's phone. There, she can interact with another object before using her mother's phone. By doing this, Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom, and just after she takes it, her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone, causing her to go back to the room. When she finally goes downstairs, she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on. She'll then talk with her mother about several topics, and at the end of the conversation, she'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels. Depending on her choice, Joyce will be either kind or tough towards her. Chloe'll have to pick the keys from her stepfather, David Madsen, and take them to him since he'll be taking her to school today. After leaving the house and going to David, he'll ask her to get the tools he needs to fix his car in the garage. After this, she gets in the car and David will try to start a conversation with her. She can either start a fight with him or listen to what he has to say. After the talk, Chloe will fall asleep and have a weird dream about being in a car with her dad, going to pick up her mom from the grocery store. The dream abruptly ends with a truck crashing through William's car. When she wakes up, she's already at Blackwell Academy. There, she can talk to Eliot Hampden (and choose whether or not she wants to watch The Tempest play with him), Victoria Chase (with the option of sabotaging her homework if doing so), Skip Matthews (with the option of listening to the demo of his band, PissHead, and giving him your opinion on it if doing so), Principal Wells (only if she sits on a crate on the stage and with the option of starting a backtalk challenge with him if doing so), Michelle Grant, Mikey North and Steph Gingrich (in order to get her DVD and with the additional option of playing a tabletop game with them), and other students. Afterwards, she'll go towards the school entrance, but she'll be interrupted by Drew North and Nathan Prescott, who are starting a fight. A student called Samantha Myers urges Chloe to do something to help Nathan, and Chloe can either backtalk Drew and defend Nathan or just ignore them, which will cause Samantha to either thank Chloe or be upset with her for not helping. When the fight is over, she can finally enter the school, and just as she opens the door, Rachel appears on the other side and pulls her along with her to the Drama Lab where Travis Keaton is rehearsing with Dana Ward and Hayden Jones. Rachel will ask for her opinion on Miranda's love for Fernando, both portrayed by Dana and Hayden respectively in ""The Tempest"" play, and Chloe can choose whether to say it's true love or not. After the class is over, everyone will leave the room, except for Chloe and Rachel. Rachel will change to normal clothes and ask Chloe to get her belt from her bag and bring it to her. After doing this, they'll have a short conversation before Rachel invites Chloe to skip school, and they end up in a train carriage where, after finding some crates to sit on, they play the game Two Truths and a Lie. Chloe can either cheat or follow the game rules. After their game, Chloe will have the option of sharing or not her earbuds with Rachel during their trip. Upon arriving at Overlook Park, they'll play another game using the viewfinders to spy on people around the park. However, the viewfinder that they intend to use it broken. Chloe asks Rachel for something sharp like a knife and she gives her a nail file, which Chloe uses to unscrew a deducation plate from a park bench and then uses it to break open the viewfinder, allowing them to use it for free. When they get a closer view of the last couple available, a man and a woman under a tree, Rachel gets distressed when they start kissing and puts an end to their game, telling Chloe she needs to get drunk. They'll then go to the other side of the park, where a couple is having a picnic and have a bottle of wine on their table. Rachel approaches the couple and starts acting sick, throwing herself to the ground and pretending to be in need of resuscitation. Chloe can encourage the man to help her, either succeeding or failing on doing so resulting in the man ""saving"" Rachel's life or the woman seeing through their ploy. Whatever the outcome is, the two girls will get the wine. After this, they're shown walking on the train tracks.

5,5,0.26984,0.27143,5,5,"Then the viewfinder and the blackness disappear and Chloe and Rachel are again sitting on the couch across from James and Rose.
[EX]   JAMES : Chloe, I believe Rachel trusts you more than anyone else right now.
[EX]   S0 : CHOICE: (Said Chloe gave Joyce money)  [EX]   FRANK : And don't try any ""I gave it to my mom"" bullshit.","Continuing from the last episode where Chloe Price is at Rachel Amber's house for dinner when Rachel accuses her father of cheating, James Amber reveals that the woman he was with in the park was Rachel's real mother, Sera Gearhardt. He then tells them the whole story, in which Chloe and Rachel then find themselves in a dark area with a viewfinder. As James tells the story, they look through the viewfinder, which shows them visuals of how Sera and James met in high school and fell in love. They had a child together (Rachel) but Sera became a drug addict. Growing fearful of Sera's behavior, James eventually left with the child and made an agreement with Sera to pay her monthly if she agreed to stay away. This worked for 15 years. Rachel is devastated and wants to meet Sera, but has no idea how to find her before heading upstairs. Chloe agrees to help (against James's wishes) and goes to Rachel's room, where she finds Rachel laying in bed and is still upset with her father's lies. After using a flashlight from a toolbox and a star globe from a night light to form a starry night, Chloe is able to talk to Rachel, promising to help find Sera. Chloe then has another dream where she is onstage in her Ariel costume on some seats that are arranged to look like car seats. William is sitting in the front row of seats, acting like he is driving. He explains the reason why people keep secrets: to keep their loved ones safe. The dream ends with an actual truck appearing onstage and crushing William, causing Chloe to fall in depression while Victoria can be heard booing her. The next morning, she returns home (in which she may discover that David had searched through her room depending on decisions made in the previous episodes) and calls Frank Bowers, who reluctantly agrees to meet Chloe at the junkyard. While heading downstairs, she sees Joyce and David embracing each other. When she tries to sneak pass them, they see her. David reveals that he has decided to trust Chloe more if she stops taking drugs but despite this, Chloe still refuses to change. David then explains the reason while he's here: his friend Phil Becker had died during their last mission in the army, and he did not want Chloe to suffer the same pain that he had when he lost his friend and hands her a photo of him and Phil. Chloe can choose whether to take the picture or reject it, which will earn David's trust or anger. She then leaves for the junkyard taking her father's toolbox and an old repair manual with her. At the junkyard, Chloe fixes the old truck (requiring repairs on four parts of the engine) and uses a spark plug from the car that was formerly owned by William to finish the repairs. After taking the truck for a test drive, she continues to wait for Frank. Rachel shows up, as does Frank - but he isn't alone. Damon Merrick is here too and demands to know why Chloe is trying to find Sera. Through a conversation, Damon reveals that he knows Sera's whereabouts and learns that Rachel is James Amber's daughter. An altercation takes place (in which Chloe can give Damon the money she took from Drew and Mikey's room if she kept it) and Rachel attacks Damon with a wooden board and is then stabbed in the arm, shocking Chloe and Frank. Frank then hold back Damon while Chloe rushes Rachel to the hospital. Once there, two nurses quickly take her to surgery while Chloe stays in the waiting room. James and Amber later show up and when James asks Chloe what happened, she tearfully tells James the whole story. Chloe can then use this time to talk to Rose, Anthony North (Drew and Mikey's father), the couple from Episode 1, Steph, Drew, and Mikey (with the option of playing one last tabletop game with them). Rachel survives but still wants to find her mother. After James leaves them to talk, she convinces Chloe to break into her dad's office and gives her a code to disarm the alarm. Before leaving, she briefly speaks to Eliot Hampden. She can also eavesdrop on a conversation (or argument) that Samantha's mother is having with either Nathan or Sean in one of the rooms regarding Samantha's injury (presumed to be Nathan's doing). While at James's office, she finds a key hidden in a trophy and uses it to unlock a drawer, which contains evidence showing that James lied about a lot of things and that Damon has Sera. She contacts Damon using James's phone (who, in return, thinks she is James) and has her do some favors: destroy the evidence (which is a glove that Chloe must burn using her lighter and a trash can), finding the snitch (which has to be anyone other than Frank) and showing him the money he promised to give him (which is hidden behind some books on the bookshelf). After all this, he then reveals that Sera is held captive at the old mill. Before she can leave, she is caught by Eliot (who had followed Chloe from the hospital) and closes the door from behind, reactivating the alarm. An argument between the two begins, in which Eliot reveals that he strongly dislikes Rachel and wants Chloe all to himself, while Chloe backtalks against him while trying to call the police by pretending to agree with Eliot. If she wins the backtalk, the police will arrive and Chloe leaves while Eliot stays behind to confront the police. If she loses, Eliot will find out what she's up to, which will make Chloe set off the alarm, forcing Eliot to leave. After escaping, she drives to the old mill. After avoiding a logger truck, she stops near the burnt forest and will speak to an illusion of William, who convinces Chloe to keep going. After arriving at the old mill, she finds Frank's RV and heads into the mill. Optionally, she can find a knife in the mill to use as a weapon against Damon. Chloe confronts Damon, who has Sera tied up in a chair. He reveals that James is paying him to kill Sera and when Chloe tries to stop him, she gets knocked to the ground and is knocked unconscious by him. An injured Frank enters and struggles with Damon, presumably killing him afterwards as Frank got the better of him. Chloe wakes up and talks with Sera, who tries to convince her to not tell Rachel about anything that happened at the mill or her father's corruptive actions (while also believing that she can never be a good mother to Rachel and wishes for her to be with a father who loves her), knowing that it will cause more hurt to Rachel while Chloe tries to convince her to meet Rachel. After the conversation, Sera lets Chloe choose whether she should tell Rachel the truth or not. Chloe can also give Sera Rachel's bracelet if she has it, but she will give it back if Chloe didn't convince her. After Sera leaves, Chloe returns to the hospital and has to decide whether to lie to Rachel (which will cause her to make amends with James) or tell her everything (which will cause her to disown her father and sever ties with him for his wrongdoings). Regardless of her choice, she and Rachel remain friends at the end. The following scenes are then shown (which will all vary depending on Chloe's choices): 1. The Amber family either happily spending time with each other or in disarray. 2. Frank sitting by his RV holding a box of Damon's things. 3. Nathan and Samantha either spending time with each other or drifting apart (if Chloe wasn't supportive of them). 4. Chloe either embracing Joyce and David or still maintaining personal issues towards David. 5. Eliot, whose actions at the Amber house had led to him being expelled, preparing to leave Blackwell and will tear up a photograph of him and Chloe if she lost the backtalk. 6. Steph, Drew, and Mikey playing a tabletop game in front of Blackwell with one of the brothers still recovering from his injuries. The remaining scenes show Chloe and Rachel spending time together. While sitting near the lighthouse, Sera will show up if she was convinced by Chloe to meet Rachel. At the very end of the episode, in the final cinematic, the fate of Rachel Amber is suggested to be similar to that of Victoria and Max's from the first game, where Rachel's phone can be seen ringing inside the underground vault with Chloe being on the other line and the click of a camera can be heard in the background, implying that Rachel is photographed by either Nathan or Jefferson.

after the conversation , sera lets chloe choose whether she should tell rachel the truth or not .
chloe can also give sera rachel 's bracelet if she has it , but she will give it back if chloe did n't convince her .

[EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Rachel looks awesome...","The episode starts with a hooded Chloe Price smoking a cigarette and standing at the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to come. After its passage, she takes off her hood and goes towards the old mill, ignoring the ""No Trespassing"" sign after jumping over a fence. In order to get inside the mill, she starts an argument with the bouncer, in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails. After entering, she can interact with people, objects, graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money (or not). If she steals the money, she'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later. After this, she'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys, the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her. However, she'll manage to see the band by going upstairs, even with the floor there being rotten. She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her. She's saved by Rachel Amber, in her very first appearance, and will have the first major choice of the game: attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing. After running downstairs, the two girls stop and look at Frank, who notices what's going to happen and quickly stops the guys, causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill. Rachel pulls Chloe along with her, and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night. The next morning, Chloe is shown waking up in her room, at the Price household. She sits up and takes her red 'Oregon' ashtray and starts smoking a cigarette (or weed, if she bought it from Frank earlier with the stolen money). Chloe can look at a photo of her and Max Caulfield as kids along with her dad, William Price and can also look at her diary. After being called by her mother, Joyce Price, for breakfast downstairs, she'll get up from her bed and will be able to interact with many objects around her room. She'll change clothes before leaving her room (the player gets to choose her outfit). Due to having drunk too much, Chloe notices her phone is missing. She then goes to her mother's room to call her phone with her mother's phone. There, she can interact with another object before using her mother's phone. By doing this, Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom, and just after she takes it, her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone, causing her to go back to the room. When she finally goes downstairs, she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on. She'll then talk with her mother about several topics, and at the end of the conversation, she'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels. Depending on her choice, Joyce will be either kind or tough towards her. Chloe'll have to pick the keys from her stepfather, David Madsen, and take them to him since he'll be taking her to school today. After leaving the house and going to David, he'll ask her to get the tools he needs to fix his car in the garage. After this, she gets in the car and David will try to start a conversation with her. She can either start a fight with him or listen to what he has to say. After the talk, Chloe will fall asleep and have a weird dream about being in a car with her dad, going to pick up her mom from the grocery store. The dream abruptly ends with a truck crashing through William's car. When she wakes up, she's already at Blackwell Academy. There, she can talk to Eliot Hampden (and choose whether or not she wants to watch The Tempest play with him), Victoria Chase (with the option of sabotaging her homework if doing so), Skip Matthews (with the option of listening to the demo of his band, PissHead, and giving him your opinion on it if doing so), Principal Wells (only if she sits on a crate on the stage and with the option of starting a backtalk challenge with him if doing so), Michelle Grant, Mikey North and Steph Gingrich (in order to get her DVD and with the additional option of playing a tabletop game with them), and other students. Afterwards, she'll go towards the school entrance, but she'll be interrupted by Drew North and Nathan Prescott, who are starting a fight. A student called Samantha Myers urges Chloe to do something to help Nathan, and Chloe can either backtalk Drew and defend Nathan or just ignore them, which will cause Samantha to either thank Chloe or be upset with her for not helping. When the fight is over, she can finally enter the school, and just as she opens the door, Rachel appears on the other side and pulls her along with her to the Drama Lab where Travis Keaton is rehearsing with Dana Ward and Hayden Jones. Rachel will ask for her opinion on Miranda's love for Fernando, both portrayed by Dana and Hayden respectively in ""The Tempest"" play, and Chloe can choose whether to say it's true love or not. After the class is over, everyone will leave the room, except for Chloe and Rachel. Rachel will change to normal clothes and ask Chloe to get her belt from her bag and bring it to her. After doing this, they'll have a short conversation before Rachel invites Chloe to skip school, and they end up in a train carriage where, after finding some crates to sit on, they play the game Two Truths and a Lie. Chloe can either cheat or follow the game rules. After their game, Chloe will have the option of sharing or not her earbuds with Rachel during their trip. Upon arriving at Overlook Park, they'll play another game using the viewfinders to spy on people around the park. However, the viewfinder that they intend to use it broken. Chloe asks Rachel for something sharp like a knife and she gives her a nail file, which Chloe uses to unscrew a deducation plate from a park bench and then uses it to break open the viewfinder, allowing them to use it for free. When they get a closer view of the last couple available, a man and a woman under a tree, Rachel gets distressed when they start kissing and puts an end to their game, telling Chloe she needs to get drunk. They'll then go to the other side of the park, where a couple is having a picnic and have a bottle of wine on their table. Rachel approaches the couple and starts acting sick, throwing herself to the ground and pretending to be in need of resuscitation. Chloe can encourage the man to help her, either succeeding or failing on doing so resulting in the man ""saving"" Rachel's life or the woman seeing through their ploy. Whatever the outcome is, the two girls will get the wine. After this, they're shown walking on the train tracks. Chloe invites Rachel to explore a junkyard nearby and Rachel lets her explore on her own. After a long conversation between the two, no matter what choices the player has made so far, Rachel will leave, but not before Chloe tries to convince her to stay. Chloe has the option to say that they have a real friendship or something more. Once Rachel leaves, Chloe gets angry and breaks everything around her. She then has a meltdown upon seeing her late father's car. She'll fall asleep and have another dream about her father, this time, with him advising/warning her on her relationship with Rachel, in which Chloe will see Rachel outside of the car, who will then catch fire. When she wakes up, it's already night and she goes back to the overlook where she finds Rachel. Upon a brief dialogue, in which Rachel reveals the man they had seen at the park was her dad, and that he was cheating on her mother with that woman. Rachel takes out a photo of her as a kid with her father, asks Chloe for her lighter which she uses it burn the photo, throwing it into a nearby trash bin, and starting a wildfire by kicking the bin into a tree nearby. Rachel then screams, increasing the fire's intensity. The episode ends showing each character's reaction to the wildfire seen in the sky.

In order to get inside the mill , she starts an argument with the bouncer , in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails .
After entering , she can interact with people , objects , graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money ( or not ) .
If she steals the money , she 'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later .
After this , she 'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that 's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys , the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her .
However , she 'll manage to see the band by going upstairs , even with the floor there being rotten .
She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her .
She 's saved by Rachel Amber , in her very first appearance , and will have the first major choice of the game : attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing .
After running downstairs , the two girls stop and look at Frank , who notices what 's going to happen and quickly stops the guys , causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill .
Rachel pulls Chloe along with her , and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night .
The next morning , Chloe is shown waking up in her room , at the Price household .
She sits up and takes her red ' Oregon ' ashtray and starts smoking a cigarette ( or weed , if she bought it from Frank earlier with the stolen money ) .
Chloe can look at a photo of her and Max Caulfield as kids along with her dad , William Price and can also look at her diary .
After being called by her mother , Joyce Price , for breakfast downstairs , she 'll get up from her bed and will be able to interact with many objects around her room .
She 'll change clothes before leaving her room ( the player gets to choose her outfit ) .
Due to having drunk too much , Chloe notices her phone is missing .
She then goes to her mother 's room to call her phone with her mother 's phone .
There , she can interact with another object before using her mother 's phone .
By doing this , Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom , and just after she takes it , her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone , causing her to go back to the room .
When she finally goes downstairs , she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on .
She 'll then talk with her mother about several topics , and at the end of the conversation , she 'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels .
Depending on her choice , Joyce will be either kind or tough towards her .
Chloe'll have to pick the keys from her stepfather , David Madsen , and take them to him since he 'll be taking her to school today .

Afterwards , she 'll go towards the school entrance , but she 'll be interrupted by Drew North and Nathan Prescott , who are starting a fight .
A student called Samantha Myers urges Chloe to do something to help Nathan , and Chloe can either backtalk Drew and defend Nathan or just ignore them , which will cause Samantha to either thank Chloe or be upset with her for not helping .
When the fight is over , she can finally enter the school , and just as she opens the door , Rachel appears on the other side and pulls her along with her to the Drama Lab where Travis Keaton is rehearsing with Dana Ward and Hayden Jones .

After the class is over , everyone will leave the room , except for Chloe and Rachel .
Rachel will change to normal clothes and ask Chloe to get her belt from her bag and bring it to her .
After doing this , they 'll have a short conversation before Rachel invites Chloe to skip school , and they end up in a train carriage where , after finding some crates to sit on , they play the game Two Truths and a Lie .

[EX]   JAMES : Chloe, I believe Rachel trusts you more than anyone else right now.
[EX]   S0 : CHOICE: (Said Chloe gave Joyce money)  [EX]   FRANK : And don't try any ""I gave it to my mom"" bullshit.","Continuing from the last episode where Chloe Price is at Rachel Amber's house for dinner when Rachel accuses her father of cheating, James Amber reveals that the woman he was with in the park was Rachel's real mother, Sera Gearhardt. He then tells them the whole story, in which Chloe and Rachel then find themselves in a dark area with a viewfinder. As James tells the story, they look through the viewfinder, which shows them visuals of how Sera and James met in high school and fell in love. They had a child together (Rachel) but Sera became a drug addict. Growing fearful of Sera's behavior, James eventually left with the child and made an agreement with Sera to pay her monthly if she agreed to stay away. This worked for 15 years. Rachel is devastated and wants to meet Sera, but has no idea how to find her before heading upstairs. Chloe agrees to help (against James's wishes) and goes to Rachel's room, where she finds Rachel laying in bed and is still upset with her father's lies. After using a flashlight from a toolbox and a star globe from a night light to form a starry night, Chloe is able to talk to Rachel, promising to help find Sera. Chloe then has another dream where she is onstage in her Ariel costume on some seats that are arranged to look like car seats. William is sitting in the front row of seats, acting like he is driving. He explains the reason why people keep secrets: to keep their loved ones safe. The dream ends with an actual truck appearing onstage and crushing William, causing Chloe to fall in depression while Victoria can be heard booing her. The next morning, she returns home (in which she may discover that David had searched through her room depending on decisions made in the previous episodes) and calls Frank Bowers, who reluctantly agrees to meet Chloe at the junkyard. While heading downstairs, she sees Joyce and David embracing each other. When she tries to sneak pass them, they see her. David reveals that he has decided to trust Chloe more if she stops taking drugs but despite this, Chloe still refuses to change. David then explains the reason while he's here: his friend Phil Becker had died during their last mission in the army, and he did not want Chloe to suffer the same pain that he had when he lost his friend and hands her a photo of him and Phil. Chloe can choose whether to take the picture or reject it, which will earn David's trust or anger. She then leaves for the junkyard taking her father's toolbox and an old repair manual with her. At the junkyard, Chloe fixes the old truck (requiring repairs on four parts of the engine) and uses a spark plug from the car that was formerly owned by William to finish the repairs. After taking the truck for a test drive, she continues to wait for Frank. Rachel shows up, as does Frank - but he isn't alone. Damon Merrick is here too and demands to know why Chloe is trying to find Sera. Through a conversation, Damon reveals that he knows Sera's whereabouts and learns that Rachel is James Amber's daughter. An altercation takes place (in which Chloe can give Damon the money she took from Drew and Mikey's room if she kept it) and Rachel attacks Damon with a wooden board and is then stabbed in the arm, shocking Chloe and Frank. Frank then hold back Damon while Chloe rushes Rachel to the hospital. Once there, two nurses quickly take her to surgery while Chloe stays in the waiting room. James and Amber later show up and when James asks Chloe what happened, she tearfully tells James the whole story. Chloe can then use this time to talk to Rose, Anthony North (Drew and Mikey's father), the couple from Episode 1, Steph, Drew, and Mikey (with the option of playing one last tabletop game with them). Rachel survives but still wants to find her mother. After James leaves them to talk, she convinces Chloe to break into her dad's office and gives her a code to disarm the alarm. Before leaving, she briefly speaks to Eliot Hampden. She can also eavesdrop on a conversation (or argument) that Samantha's mother is having with either Nathan or Sean in one of the rooms regarding Samantha's injury (presumed to be Nathan's doing). While at James's office, she finds a key hidden in a trophy and uses it to unlock a drawer, which contains evidence showing that James lied about a lot of things and that Damon has Sera. She contacts Damon using James's phone (who, in return, thinks she is James) and has her do some favors: destroy the evidence (which is a glove that Chloe must burn using her lighter and a trash can), finding the snitch (which has to be anyone other than Frank) and showing him the money he promised to give him (which is hidden behind some books on the bookshelf). After all this, he then reveals that Sera is held captive at the old mill. Before she can leave, she is caught by Eliot (who had followed Chloe from the hospital) and closes the door from behind, reactivating the alarm. An argument between the two begins, in which Eliot reveals that he strongly dislikes Rachel and wants Chloe all to himself, while Chloe backtalks against him while trying to call the police by pretending to agree with Eliot. If she wins the backtalk, the police will arrive and Chloe leaves while Eliot stays behind to confront the police. If she loses, Eliot will find out what she's up to, which will make Chloe set off the alarm, forcing Eliot to leave. After escaping, she drives to the old mill. After avoiding a logger truck, she stops near the burnt forest and will speak to an illusion of William, who convinces Chloe to keep going. After arriving at the old mill, she finds Frank's RV and heads into the mill. Optionally, she can find a knife in the mill to use as a weapon against Damon. Chloe confronts Damon, who has Sera tied up in a chair. He reveals that James is paying him to kill Sera and when Chloe tries to stop him, she gets knocked to the ground and is knocked unconscious by him. An injured Frank enters and struggles with Damon, presumably killing him afterwards as Frank got the better of him. Chloe wakes up and talks with Sera, who tries to convince her to not tell Rachel about anything that happened at the mill or her father's corruptive actions (while also believing that she can never be a good mother to Rachel and wishes for her to be with a father who loves her), knowing that it will cause more hurt to Rachel while Chloe tries to convince her to meet Rachel. After the conversation, Sera lets Chloe choose whether she should tell Rachel the truth or not. Chloe can also give Sera Rachel's bracelet if she has it, but she will give it back if Chloe didn't convince her. After Sera leaves, Chloe returns to the hospital and has to decide whether to lie to Rachel (which will cause her to make amends with James) or tell her everything (which will cause her to disown her father and sever ties with him for his wrongdoings). Regardless of her choice, she and Rachel remain friends at the end. The following scenes are then shown (which will all vary depending on Chloe's choices): 1. The Amber family either happily spending time with each other or in disarray. 2. Frank sitting by his RV holding a box of Damon's things. 3. Nathan and Samantha either spending time with each other or drifting apart (if Chloe wasn't supportive of them). 4. Chloe either embracing Joyce and David or still maintaining personal issues towards David. 5. Eliot, whose actions at the Amber house had led to him being expelled, preparing to leave Blackwell and will tear up a photograph of him and Chloe if she lost the backtalk. 6. Steph, Drew, and Mikey playing a tabletop game in front of Blackwell with one of the brothers still recovering from his injuries. The remaining scenes show Chloe and Rachel spending time together. While sitting near the lighthouse, Sera will show up if she was convinced by Chloe to meet Rachel. At the very end of the episode, in the final cinematic, the fate of Rachel Amber is suggested to be similar to that of Victoria and Max's from the first game, where Rachel's phone can be seen ringing inside the underground vault with Chloe being on the other line and the click of a camera can be heard in the background, implying that Rachel is photographed by either Nathan or Jefferson.

Growing fearful of Sera's behavior, James eventually left with the child and made an agreement with Sera to pay her monthly if she agreed to stay away. This worked for 15 years. Rachel is devastated and wants to meet Sera, but has no idea how to find her before heading upstairs. Chloe agrees to help (against James's wishes) and goes to Rachel's room, where she finds Rachel laying in bed and is still upset with her father's lies. After using a flashlight from a toolbox and a star globe from a night light to form a starry night, Chloe is able to talk to Rachel, promising to help find Sera. Chloe then has another dream where she is onstage in her Ariel costume on some seats that are arranged to look like car seats. William is sitting in the front row of seats, acting like he is driving. He explains the reason why people keep secrets: to keep their loved ones safe. The dream ends with an actual truck appearing onstage and crushing William, causing Chloe to fall in depression while Victoria can be heard booing her. The next morning, she returns home (in which she may discover that David had searched through her room depending on decisions made in the previous episodes) and calls Frank Bowers, who reluctantly agrees to meet Chloe at the junkyard. While heading downstairs, she sees Joyce and David embracing each other. When she tries to sneak pass them, they see her. David reveals that he has decided to trust Chloe more if she stops taking drugs but despite this, Chloe still refuses to change. David then explains the reason while he's here: his friend Phil Becker had died during their last mission in the army, and he did not want Chloe to suffer the same pain that he had when he lost his friend and hands her a photo of him and Phil. Chloe can choose whether to take the picture or reject it, which will earn David's trust or anger. She then leaves for the junkyard taking her father's toolbox and an old repair manual with her. At the junkyard, Chloe fixes the old truck (requiring repairs on four parts of the engine) and uses a spark plug from the car that was formerly owned by William to finish the repairs. After taking the truck for a test drive, she continues to wait for Frank. Rachel shows up, as does Frank - but he isn't alone. Damon Merrick is here too and demands to know why Chloe is trying to find Sera. Through a conversation, Damon reveals that he knows Sera's whereabouts and learns that Rachel is James Amber's daughter. An altercation takes place (in which Chloe can give Damon the money she took from Drew and Mikey's room if she kept it) and Rachel attacks Damon with a wooden board and is then stabbed in the arm, shocking Chloe and Frank. Frank then hold back Damon while Chloe rushes Rachel to the hospital. Once there, two nurses quickly take her to surgery while Chloe stays in the waiting room. James and Amber later show up and when James asks Chloe what happened, she tearfully tells James the whole story. Chloe can then use this time to talk to Rose, Anthony North (Drew and Mikey's father), the couple from Episode 1, Steph, Drew, and Mikey (with the option of playing one last tabletop game with them). Rachel survives but still wants to find her mother. After James leaves them to talk, she convinces Chloe to break into her dad's office and gives her a code to disarm the alarm. Before leaving, she briefly speaks to Eliot Hampden. She can also eavesdrop on a conversation (or argument) that Samantha's mother is having with either Nathan or Sean in one of the rooms regarding Samantha's injury (presumed to be Nathan's doing). While at James's office, she finds a key hidden in a trophy and uses it to unlock a drawer, which contains evidence showing that James lied about a lot of things and that Damon has Sera. She contacts Damon using James's phone (who, in return, thinks she is James) and has her do some favors: destroy the evidence (which is a glove that Chloe must burn using her lighter and a trash can), finding the snitch (which has to be anyone other than Frank) and showing him the money he promised to give him (which is hidden behind some books on the bookshelf). After all this, he then reveals that Sera is held captive at the old mill. Before she can leave, she is caught by Eliot (who had followed Chloe from the hospital) and closes the door from behind, reactivating the alarm. An argument between the two begins, in which Eliot reveals that he strongly dislikes Rachel and wants Chloe all to himself, while Chloe backtalks against him while trying to call the police by pretending to agree with Eliot. If she wins the backtalk, the police will arrive and Chloe leaves while Eliot stays behind to confront the police. If she loses, Eliot will find out what she's up to, which will make Chloe set off the alarm, forcing Eliot to leave. After escaping, she drives to the old mill. After avoiding a logger truck, she stops near the burnt forest and will speak to an illusion of William, who convinces Chloe to keep going. After arriving at the old mill, she finds Frank's RV and heads into the mill. Optionally, she can find a knife in the mill to use as a weapon against Damon. Chloe confronts Damon, who has Sera tied up in a chair. He reveals that James is paying him to kill Sera and when Chloe tries to stop him, she gets knocked to the ground and is knocked unconscious by him. An injured Frank enters and struggles with Damon, presumably killing him afterwards as Frank got the better of him. Chloe wakes up and talks with Sera, who tries to convince her to not tell Rachel about anything that happened at the mill or her father's corruptive actions (while also believing that she can never be a good mother to Rachel and wishes for her to be with a father who loves her), knowing that it will cause more hurt to Rachel while Chloe tries to convince her to meet Rachel. After the conversation, Sera lets Chloe choose whether she should tell Rachel the truth or not. Chloe can also give Sera Rachel's bracelet if she has it, but she will give it back if Chloe didn't convince her. After Sera leaves, Chloe returns to the hospital and has to decide whether to lie to Rachel (which will cause her to make amends with James) or tell her everything (which will cause her to disown her father and sever ties with him for his wrongdoings). Regardless of her choice, she and Rachel remain friends at the end. The following scenes are then shown (which will all vary depending on Chloe's choices): 1. The Amber family either happily spending time with each other or in disarray. 2. Frank sitting by his RV holding a box of Damon's things. 3. Nathan and Samantha either spending time with each other or drifting apart (if Chloe wasn't supportive of them). 4. Chloe either embracing Joyce and David or still maintaining personal issues towards David. 5. Eliot, whose actions at the Amber house had led to him being expelled, preparing to leave Blackwell and will tear up a photograph of him and Chloe if she lost the backtalk. 6. Steph, Drew, and Mikey playing a tabletop game in front of Blackwell with one of the brothers still recovering from his injuries. The remaining scenes show Chloe and Rachel spending time together. While sitting near the lighthouse, Sera will show up if she was convinced by Chloe to meet Rachel. At the very end of the episode, in the final cinematic, the fate of Rachel Amber is suggested to be similar to that of Victoria and Max's from the first game, where Rachel's phone can be seen ringing inside the underground vault with Chloe being on the other line and the click of a camera can be heard in the background, implying that Rachel is photographed by either Nathan or Jefferson.

chloe then has another dream where she is onstage in her ariel costume on some seats that are arranged to look like car seats .
william is sitting in the front row of seats , acting like he is driving .
he explains the reason why people keep secrets : to keep their loved ones safe .
the dream ends with an actual truck appearing onstage and crushing william , causing chloe to fall in depression while victoria can be heard booing her .
the next morning , she returns home ( in which she may discover that david had searched through her room depending on decisions made in the previous episodes ) and calls frank bowers , who reluctantly agrees to meet chloe at the junkyard .
while heading downstairs , she sees joyce and david embracing each other .
when she tries to sneak pass them , they see her .
david reveals that he has decided to trust chloe more if she stops taking drugs but despite this , chloe still refuses to change .
david then explains the reason while he 's here : his friend phil becker had died during their last mission in the army , and he did not want chloe to suffer the same pain that he had when he lost his friend and hands her a photo of him and phil .
chloe can choose whether to take the picture or reject it , which will earn david 's trust or anger .
she then leaves for the junkyard taking her father 's toolbox and an old repair manual with her .
at the junkyard , chloe fixes the old truck ( requiring repairs on four parts of the engine ) and uses a spark plug from the car that was formerly owned by william to finish the repairs .
after taking the truck for a test drive , she continues to wait for frank .
rachel shows up , as does frank - but he is n't alone .
damon merrick is here too and demands to know why chloe is trying to find sera .
through a conversation , damon reveals that he knows sera 's whereabouts and learns that rachel is james amber 's daughter .
an altercation takes place ( in which chloe can give damon the money she took from drew and mikey 's room if she kept it ) and rachel attacks damon with a wooden board and is then stabbed in the arm , shocking chloe and frank .
frank then hold back damon while chloe rushes rachel to the hospital .
once there , two nurses quickly take her to surgery while chloe stays in the waiting room .
james and amber later show up and when james asks chloe what happened , she tearfully tells james the whole story .
chloe can then use this time to talk to rose , anthony north ( drew and mikey 's father ) , the couple from episode 1 , steph , drew , and mikey ( with the option of playing one last tabletop game with them ) .
rachel survives but still wants to find her mother .
after james leaves them to talk , she convinces chloe to break into her dad 's office and gives her a code to disarm the alarm .
before leaving , she briefly speaks to eliot hampden .
she can also eavesdrop on a conversation ( or argument ) that samantha 's mother is having with either nathan or sean in one of the rooms regarding samantha 's injury ( presumed to be nathan 's doing ) .
while at james 's office , she finds a key hidden in a trophy and uses it to unlock a drawer , which contains evidence showing that james lied about a lot of things and that damon has sera .
she contacts damon using james 's phone ( who , in return , thinks she is james ) and has her do some favors : destroy the evidence ( which is a glove that chloe must burn using her lighter and a trash can ) , finding the snitch ( which has to be anyone other than frank ) and showing him the money he promised to give him ( which is hidden behind some books on the bookshelf ) .
after all this , he then reveals that sera is held captive at the old mill .
before she can leave , she is caught by eliot ( who had followed chloe from the hospital ) and closes the door from behind , reactivating the alarm .
an argument between the two begins , in which eliot reveals that he strongly dislikes rachel and wants chloe all to himself , while chloe backtalks against him while trying to call the police by pretending to agree with eliot .
if she wins the backtalk , the police will arrive and chloe leaves while eliot stays behind to confront the police .
if she loses , eliot will find out what she 's up to , which will make chloe set off the alarm , forcing eliot to leave .
after escaping , she drives to the old mill .
after avoiding a logger truck , she stops near the burnt forest and will speak to an illusion of william , who convinces chloe to keep going .
after arriving at the old mill , she finds frank 's rv and heads into the mill .
optionally , she can find a knife in the mill to use as a weapon against damon .
chloe confronts damon , who has sera tied up in a chair .
he reveals that james is paying him to kill sera and when chloe tries to stop him , she gets knocked to the ground and is knocked unconscious by him .
an injured frank enters and struggles with damon , presumably killing him afterwards as frank got the better of him .
chloe wakes up and talks with sera , who tries to convince her to not tell rachel about anything that happened at the mill or her father 's corruptive actions ( while also believing that she can never be a good mother to rachel and wishes for her to be with a father who loves her ) , knowing that it will cause more hurt to rachel while chloe tries to convince her to meet rachel .
after the conversation , sera lets chloe choose whether she should tell rachel the truth or not .
chloe can also give sera rachel 's bracelet if she has it , but she will give it back if chloe did n't convince her .
after sera leaves , chloe returns to the hospital and has to decide whether to lie to rachel ( which will cause her to make amends with james ) or tell her everything ( which will cause her to disown her father and sever ties with him for his wrongdoings ) .
regardless of her choice , she and rachel remain friends at the end .
the following scenes are then shown ( which will all vary depending on chloe 's choices ): 1 .

Chloe agrees to help ( against James 's wishes ) and goes to Rachel 's room , where she finds Rachel laying in bed and is still upset with her father 's lies .
After using a flashlight from a toolbox and a star globe from a night light to form a starry night , Chloe is able to talk to Rachel , promising to help find Sera .
Chloe then has another dream where she is onstage in her Ariel costume on some seats that are arranged to look like car seats .
William is sitting in the front row of seats , acting like he is driving .
He explains the reason why people keep secrets : to keep their loved ones safe .
The dream ends with an actual truck appearing onstage and crushing William , causing Chloe to fall in depression while Victoria can be heard booing her .
The next morning , she returns home ( in which she may discover that David had searched through her room depending on decisions made in the previous episodes ) and calls Frank Bowers , who reluctantly agrees to meet Chloe at the junkyard .
While heading downstairs , she sees Joyce and David embracing each other .
When she tries to sneak pass them , they see her .
David reveals that he has decided to trust Chloe more if she stops taking drugs but despite this , Chloe still refuses to change .
David then explains the reason while he 's here : his friend Phil Becker had died during their last mission in the army , and he did not want Chloe to suffer the same pain that he had when he lost his friend and hands her a photo of him and Phil .
Chloe can choose whether to take the picture or reject it , which will earn David 's trust or anger .
She then leaves for the junkyard taking her father 's toolbox and an old repair manual with her .
At the junkyard , Chloe fixes the old truck ( requiring repairs on four parts of the engine ) and uses a spark plug from the car that was formerly owned by William to finish the repairs .
After taking the truck for a test drive , she continues to wait for Frank .
Rachel shows up , as does Frank - but he is n't alone .
Damon Merrick is here too and demands to know why Chloe is trying to find Sera .
Through a conversation , Damon reveals that he knows Sera 's whereabouts and learns that Rachel is James Amber 's daughter .
An altercation takes place ( in which Chloe can give Damon the money she took from Drew and Mikey 's room if she kept it ) and Rachel attacks Damon with a wooden board and is then stabbed in the arm , shocking Chloe and Frank .
Frank then hold back Damon while Chloe rushes Rachel to the hospital .
Once there , two nurses quickly take her to surgery while Chloe stays in the waiting room .
James and Amber later show up and when James asks Chloe what happened , she tearfully tells James the whole story .
Chloe can then use this time to talk to Rose , Anthony North ( Drew and Mikey 's father ) , the couple from Episode 1 , Steph , Drew , and Mikey ( with the option of playing one last tabletop game with them ) .
Rachel survives but still wants to find her mother .
After James leaves them to talk , she convinces Chloe to break into her dad 's office and gives her a code to disarm the alarm .
Before leaving , she briefly speaks to Eliot Hampden .
She can also eavesdrop on a conversation ( or argument ) that Samantha 's mother is having with either Nathan or Sean in one of the rooms regarding Samantha 's injury ( presumed to be Nathan 's doing ) .
While at James 's office , she finds a key hidden in a trophy and uses it to unlock a drawer , which contains evidence showing that James lied about a lot of things and that Damon has Sera .
She contacts Damon using James 's phone ( who , in return , thinks she is James ) and has her do some favors : destroy the evidence ( which is a glove that Chloe must burn using her lighter and a trash can ) , finding the snitch ( which has to be anyone other than Frank ) and showing him the money he promised to give him ( which is hidden behind some books on the bookshelf ) .
After all this , he then reveals that Sera is held captive at the old mill .
Before she can leave , she is caught by Eliot ( who had followed Chloe from the hospital ) and closes the door from behind , reactivating the alarm .
An argument between the two begins , in which Eliot reveals that he strongly dislikes Rachel and wants Chloe all to himself , while Chloe backtalks against him while trying to call the police by pretending to agree with Eliot .
If she wins the backtalk , the police will arrive and Chloe leaves while Eliot stays behind to confront the police .
If she loses , Eliot will find out what she 's up to , which will make Chloe set off the alarm , forcing Eliot to leave .
After escaping , she drives to the old mill .
After avoiding a logger truck , she stops near the burnt forest and will speak to an illusion of William , who convinces Chloe to keep going .
After arriving at the old mill , she finds Frank 's RV and heads into the mill .
Optionally , she can find a knife in the mill to use as a weapon against Damon .
Chloe confronts Damon , who has Sera tied up in a chair .
He reveals that James is paying him to kill Sera and when Chloe tries to stop him , she gets knocked to the ground and is knocked unconscious by him .
An injured Frank enters and struggles with Damon , presumably killing him afterwards as Frank got the better of him .
Chloe wakes up and talks with Sera , who tries to convince her to not tell Rachel about anything that happened at the mill or her father 's corruptive actions ( while also believing that she can never be a good mother to Rachel and wishes for her to be with a father who loves her ) , knowing that it will cause more hurt to Rachel while Chloe tries to convince her to meet Rachel .
After the conversation , Sera lets Chloe choose whether she should tell Rachel the truth or not .
Chloe can also give Sera Rachel 's bracelet if she has it , but she will give it back if Chloe did n't convince her .
After Sera leaves , Chloe returns to the hospital and has to decide whether to lie to Rachel ( which will cause her to make amends with James ) or tell her everything ( which will cause her to disown her father and sever ties with him for his wrongdoings ) .
Regardless of her choice , she and Rachel remain friends at the end .
The following scenes are then shown ( which will all vary depending on Chloe 's choices ): 1 .
The Amber family either happily spending time with each other or in disarray .
2 .
Frank sitting by his RV holding a box of Damon 's things .
3 .
Nathan and Samantha either spending time with each other or drifting apart ( if Chloe was n't supportive of them ) .
4 .
Chloe either embracing Joyce and David or still maintaining personal issues towards David .
5 .
Eliot , whose actions at the Amber house had led to him being expelled , preparing to leave Blackwell and will tear up a photograph of him and Chloe if she lost the backtalk . 6 .
Steph , Drew , and Mikey playing a tabletop game in front of Blackwell with one of the brothers still recovering from his injuries .
The remaining scenes show Chloe and Rachel spending time together .
While sitting near the lighthouse , Sera will show up if she was convinced by Chloe to meet Rachel .
At the very end of the episode , in the final cinematic , the fate of Rachel Amber is suggested to be similar to that of Victoria and Max 's from the first game , where Rachel 's phone can be seen ringing inside the underground vault with Chloe being on the other line and the click of a camera can be heard in the background , implying that Rachel is photographed by either Nathan or Jefferson ."

Both Rachel and Chloe are questioned about their absence the day before. The conversation varies depending on how Chloe treated Joyce, if she sabotaged Victoria's homework, if she went onstage and smoked weed, whether she helped Nathan or not, and if she won or lost the backtalk against Drew (if she helped Nathan). Rachel claims their misbehavior was her idea, and as punishment, is removed as Wells' administrative assistant and her role as Prospera in The Tempest. If Chloe goes along with Rachel, she will be suspended. If Chloe takes the blame for Rachel, she will be expelled, but Rachel won't be removed from the play. After they leave the office, Skip Matthews escorts Chloe to her locker, so she can clean it out. Chloe searches for her hidden joint but discovers Justin Williams has taken it. Angry, Chloe lies to Skip that she has to use the bathroom. Meanwhile, Joyce speaks with Rachel's parents, James, and Rose Amber. Once inside, she proceeds to tag it from ceiling to floor, venting her frustration. She then exits and Victoria approaches the bathroom, looking dumbfounded as she opens the door. Chloe enters the parking lot of Blackwell Academy. She can optionally talk to Eliot, who will feel sympathy for her expulsion or suspension and offer her a hug. He will again ask her if she wants to go to the play with him. Chloe walks to the car where Joyce and David are waiting for her; David asks her to empty her pockets on the hood of the car. David later announces that he will be moving in with them. This outrages Chloe and she storms off. David stops Joyce from going after her, wanting to give her some time to get over her anger. Chloe goes to the junkyard and knocks over items with her bat until she notices a very old truck. She scours the junkyard for various items needed to fix the truck: a battery from an impounded truck (which requires having to press a button to unlock the hood); something to cover the hole in the floor: a rug, a welcome mat, or a golf mat; a new light bulb from either a fish tank, a toy robot, or a Christmas wreath; and something to cover the torn seat: a pirate flag or a beach towel. She can also optionally decorate the truck using an Elvis Presley bobblehead found in a small box somewhere in the junkyard and draw a decoration on the back of the seat. Despite all her hard work, the truck still remains inoperational. She then relaxes in the driver's seat and smokes a cigarette. Chloe finds herself in another one of her dreams. She finds William, her deceased father, roasting marshmallows in the burning wreckage of his car. She sits next to him and roasts marshmallows too, as he warns her about the danger of fire, a metaphor for Rachel Amber. The dream ends with William's face being shown half-burnt with a raven pecking at his face. Chloe wakes up to find Rachel tapping on the window of her car, carrying a duffel bag. Rachel gets inside the car and the two have a ""therapy session"" (which will vary depending on if Rachel was removed from the play or not): they discuss their feelings about the current events in their life and how unhappy they are with them. Rachel leaves and gives Chloe her duffel bag, which is full of clothes. Chloe receives a call from Frank Bowers, who wants to meet up with her. Chloe enters the Hideout in the junkyard. She can optionally spruce up the place and then changes into one of Rachel's outfits. Frank approaches in his RV. Chloe sees a woman leaving the vehicle. She enters Frank's RV and he drives away. He asks her to retrieve his account book. Chloe opens the door to his bedroom, and Pompidou runs out. She takes his account book and brings it to him. Chloe then asks Frank about the woman, but he refuses to say anything. Frank reveals that Drew North runs Oxy for Damon Merrick and he owes him $1,000. He asks her to go to the school to find the money and bring it to him. After Frank drops off Chloe, she can speak with Steph Gingrich, Evan Harris, and Samuel Taylor. She shoos away a bird that Evan is photographing to distract him long enough for Chloe to damage a nearby sprinkler. This gets Samuel's attention and while he goes to fix the sprinkler, Chloe takes his keys and uses it to unlock the dorm, but encounters Skip. An argument begins, which will earn either Skip's trust or anger before he leaves to deal with an unauthorized vehicle in the parking lot (presumably Frank's RV). After she enters Drew and Mikey's room, she must figure out the combination to a locked trunk containing the money. If she fails too many times, she will get help from Steph. After getting the money, she is caught by Mikey and Drew (who are preparing to leave), followed by the arrival of Damon. Drew goes out to talk to him while telling Chloe not to leave the room. Upon hearing Damon beat up Drew, Chloe must choose whether to intervene or stay in the room, which will lead Drew to be glad for staying out of the way or upset for interfering. If she stays out of the fight, Drew will get injured and after Damon leaves, Chloe must choose to give the money to Drew or keep it. If she intervenes, Mikey will get hurt instead and Chloe will hand the money over to Damon, who then leaves. It is now late afternoon and Blackwell begins to start the play. Chloe can find Samantha Myers overhearing Nathan Prescott talking with his father, who wants his son to get over his fear and not humiliate him. Chloe can choose whether to talk to him or keep quiet. She can then convince Samantha to cheer for Nathan and can also encourage Nathan, be sarcastic towards him, or do nothing. Afterwards, she can talk to Hayden Jones, Dana Ward, and Travis Keaton and has the option of playing with the spotlights. In the changing room, Chloe will face a situation between Rachel and Victoria which varies depending on if Rachel was dropped from the play or not. If Rachel was removed from the play, this will lead to either Chloe getting Victoria to drop from the play via backtalk or Rachel drugging Victoria's tea if Chloe was nice to Victoria or lost the backtalk. If Rachel wasn't removed, Victoria will drug Rachel's tea instead. Chloe can either warn Rachel or distract Victoria. If she warns Rachel, she will get Victoria to drink the drugged tea by pretending to believe her. If Chloe distracts Victoria, she will temporally leave and Chloe will switch the cups, leading Victoria to drink the drugged tea upon returning. Keaton later informs the students that Juliet Watson, who was meant to play as Ariel, is delayed by the wildfire that Rachel caused and can't make it in time. Following this, Victoria will then either drop from the play (in which Rachel will then volunteer to take over for Victoria) or fall unconscious. Rachel then convinces a reluctant Chloe to take over for Juliet. As Chloe and Rachel perform onstage as Prospera and Ariel, Nathan then comes in, who will either leave in embarrassment or have confidence and play out his role. Juliet later arrives and replaces Chloe's spot in the play. At the end of the play, Rachel, Hayden, Dana, Juliet, Keaton, and Nathan all come out and bow to the audience, with Rachel bringing Chloe out to join the other performers. The mysterious woman from earlier is seen watching them from a distance. Rachel and Chloe are next seen wandering down a street together. Rachel is happy about the play and how Chloe took part in it. The two then discuss their plan to leave Arcadia Bay, in which Chloe can either receive Rachel's bracelet, a promise for a tattoo, or a kiss. After the conversation, they then head to Rachel's house to pick up clothes. Rachel and Chloe attempt to sneak upstairs but are caught by James. When James compliments her performance, her mood changes, and she despondently replies ""thanks"". Rachel heads upstairs to freshen up, leaving Chloe with her parents. Chloe then helps Rose set up plates and cups for the dinner table, question James of what he wants to drink (in which he will ask for Sherry), and light the candles on the table with her lighter. The four all sit down for dinner and Rachel's parents begin talking about the forest fire and the reports that it was arson. The conversation soon turns into an argument when Rachel's anger visibly increases throughout James's lecture. Chloe can either calm Rachel down or attack James on his misdeeds with her backtalk. Whichever option is chosen, Rachel will lose her temper and call James out. When Chloe and Rose join in the argument, Rachel begins to dissociate and eventually throws a salad bowl through the table, smashing it. She screams at James to tell her the truth. James tells her that the woman he kissed was not his mistress, but is in fact, Rachel's biological mother. The episode ends with scenes showing Steph at the hospital to see Drew and Mikey, Joyce embracing David in despair upon seeing that Chloe hasn't returned, Rachel's biological mother smoking a cigarette, Damon approaching Frank (how they will react depends on whether Chloe gave the money to Damon, Drew, or kept it), Victoria looking at a Tempest poster the dressing room before stepping on it and leaving, Samantha approaching Nathan, and the wildfire still happening in the distance.

Both Rachel and Chloe are questioned about their absence the day before. The conversation varies depending on how Chloe treated Joyce, if she sabotaged Victoria's homework, if she went onstage and smoked weed, whether she helped Nathan or not, and if she won or lost the backtalk against Drew (if she helped Nathan). Rachel claims their misbehavior was her idea, and as punishment, is removed as Wells' administrative assistant and her role as Prospera in The Tempest. If Chloe goes along with Rachel, she will be suspended. If Chloe takes the blame for Rachel, she will be expelled, but Rachel won't be removed from the play. After they leave the office, Skip Matthews escorts Chloe to her locker, so she can clean it out. Chloe searches for her hidden joint but discovers Justin Williams has taken it. Angry, Chloe lies to Skip that she has to use the bathroom. Meanwhile, Joyce speaks with Rachel's parents, James, and Rose Amber. Once inside, she proceeds to tag it from ceiling to floor, venting her frustration. She then exits and Victoria approaches the bathroom, looking dumbfounded as she opens the door. Chloe enters the parking lot of Blackwell Academy. She can optionally talk to Eliot, who will feel sympathy for her expulsion or suspension and offer her a hug. He will again ask her if she wants to go to the play with him. Chloe walks to the car where Joyce and David are waiting for her; David asks her to empty her pockets on the hood of the car. David later announces that he will be moving in with them. This outrages Chloe and she storms off. David stops Joyce from going after her, wanting to give her some time to get over her anger. Chloe goes to the junkyard and knocks over items with her bat until she notices a very old truck. She scours the junkyard for various items needed to fix the truck: a battery from an impounded truck (which requires having to press a button to unlock the hood); something to cover the hole in the floor: a rug, a welcome mat, or a golf mat; a new light bulb from either a fish tank, a toy robot, or a Christmas wreath; and something to cover the torn seat: a pirate flag or a beach towel. She can also optionally decorate the truck using an Elvis Presley bobblehead found in a small box somewhere in the junkyard and draw a decoration on the back of the seat. Despite all her hard work, the truck still remains inoperational. She then relaxes in the driver's seat and smokes a cigarette. Chloe finds herself in another one of her dreams. She finds William, her deceased father, roasting marshmallows in the burning wreckage of his car. She sits next to him and roasts marshmallows too, as he warns her about the danger of fire, a metaphor for Rachel Amber. The dream ends with William's face being shown half-burnt with a raven pecking at his face. Chloe wakes up to find Rachel tapping on the window of her car, carrying a duffel bag. Rachel gets inside the car and the two have a ""therapy session"" (which will vary depending on if Rachel was removed from the play or not): they discuss their feelings about the current events in their life and how unhappy they are with them. Rachel leaves and gives Chloe her duffel bag, which is full of clothes. Chloe receives a call from Frank Bowers, who wants to meet up with her. Chloe enters the Hideout in the junkyard. She can optionally spruce up the place and then changes into one of Rachel's outfits. Frank approaches in his RV. Chloe sees a woman leaving the vehicle. She enters Frank's RV and he drives away. He asks her to retrieve his account book. Chloe opens the door to his bedroom, and Pompidou runs out. She takes his account book and brings it to him. Chloe then asks Frank about the woman, but he refuses to say anything. Frank reveals that Drew North runs Oxy for Damon Merrick and he owes him $1,000. He asks her to go to the school to find the money and bring it to him. After Frank drops off Chloe, she can speak with Steph Gingrich, Evan Harris, and Samuel Taylor. She shoos away a bird that Evan is photographing to distract him long enough for Chloe to damage a nearby sprinkler. This gets Samuel's attention and while he goes to fix the sprinkler, Chloe takes his keys and uses it to unlock the dorm, but encounters Skip. An argument begins, which will earn either Skip's trust or anger before he leaves to deal with an unauthorized vehicle in the parking lot (presumably Frank's RV). After she enters Drew and Mikey's room, she must figure out the combination to a locked trunk containing the money. If she fails too many times, she will get help from Steph. After getting the money, she is caught by Mikey and Drew (who are preparing to leave), followed by the arrival of Damon. Drew goes out to talk to him while telling Chloe not to leave the room. Upon hearing Damon beat up Drew, Chloe must choose whether to intervene or stay in the room, which will lead Drew to be glad for staying out of the way or upset for interfering. If she stays out of the fight, Drew will get injured and after Damon leaves, Chloe must choose to give the money to Drew or keep it. If she intervenes, Mikey will get hurt instead and Chloe will hand the money over to Damon, who then leaves. It is now late afternoon and Blackwell begins to start the play. Chloe can find Samantha Myers overhearing Nathan Prescott talking with his father, who wants his son to get over his fear and not humiliate him. Chloe can choose whether to talk to him or keep quiet. She can then convince Samantha to cheer for Nathan and can also encourage Nathan, be sarcastic towards him, or do nothing. Afterwards, she can talk to Hayden Jones, Dana Ward, and Travis Keaton and has the option of playing with the spotlights. In the changing room, Chloe will face a situation between Rachel and Victoria which varies depending on if Rachel was dropped from the play or not. If Rachel was removed from the play, this will lead to either Chloe getting Victoria to drop from the play via backtalk or Rachel drugging Victoria's tea if Chloe was nice to Victoria or lost the backtalk. If Rachel wasn't removed, Victoria will drug Rachel's tea instead. Chloe can either warn Rachel or distract Victoria. If she warns Rachel, she will get Victoria to drink the drugged tea by pretending to believe her. If Chloe distracts Victoria, she will temporally leave and Chloe will switch the cups, leading Victoria to drink the drugged tea upon returning. Keaton later informs the students that Juliet Watson, who was meant to play as Ariel, is delayed by the wildfire that Rachel caused and can't make it in time. Following this, Victoria will then either drop from the play (in which Rachel will then volunteer to take over for Victoria) or fall unconscious. Rachel then convinces a reluctant Chloe to take over for Juliet. As Chloe and Rachel perform onstage as Prospera and Ariel, Nathan then comes in, who will either leave in embarrassment or have confidence and play out his role. Juliet later arrives and replaces Chloe's spot in the play. At the end of the play, Rachel, Hayden, Dana, Juliet, Keaton, and Nathan all come out and bow to the audience, with Rachel bringing Chloe out to join the other performers. The mysterious woman from earlier is seen watching them from a distance. Rachel and Chloe are next seen wandering down a street together. Rachel is happy about the play and how Chloe took part in it. The two then discuss their plan to leave Arcadia Bay, in which Chloe can either receive Rachel's bracelet, a promise for a tattoo, or a kiss. After the conversation, they then head to Rachel's house to pick up clothes. Rachel and Chloe attempt to sneak upstairs but are caught by James. When James compliments her performance, her mood changes, and she despondently replies ""thanks"". Rachel heads upstairs to freshen up, leaving Chloe with her parents.

Rachel gets inside the car and the two have a ""therapy session"" (which will vary depending on if Rachel was removed from the play or not): they discuss their feelings about the current events in their life and how unhappy they are with them. Rachel leaves and gives Chloe her duffel bag, which is full of clothes. Chloe receives a call from Frank Bowers, who wants to meet up with her. Chloe enters the Hideout in the junkyard. She can optionally spruce up the place and then changes into one of Rachel's outfits. Frank approaches in his RV. Chloe sees a woman leaving the vehicle. She enters Frank's RV and he drives away. He asks her to retrieve his account book. Chloe opens the door to his bedroom, and Pompidou runs out. She takes his account book and brings it to him. Chloe then asks Frank about the woman, but he refuses to say anything. Frank reveals that Drew North runs Oxy for Damon Merrick and he owes him $1,000. He asks her to go to the school to find the money and bring it to him. After Frank drops off Chloe, she can speak with Steph Gingrich, Evan Harris, and Samuel Taylor. She shoos away a bird that Evan is photographing to distract him long enough for Chloe to damage a nearby sprinkler. This gets Samuel's attention and while he goes to fix the sprinkler, Chloe takes his keys and uses it to unlock the dorm, but encounters Skip. An argument begins, which will earn either Skip's trust or anger before he leaves to deal with an unauthorized vehicle in the parking lot (presumably Frank's RV). After she enters Drew and Mikey's room, she must figure out the combination to a locked trunk containing the money. If she fails too many times, she will get help from Steph. After getting the money, she is caught by Mikey and Drew (who are preparing to leave), followed by the arrival of Damon. Drew goes out to talk to him while telling Chloe not to leave the room. Upon hearing Damon beat up Drew, Chloe must choose whether to intervene or stay in the room, which will lead Drew to be glad for staying out of the way or upset for interfering. If she stays out of the fight, Drew will get injured and after Damon leaves, Chloe must choose to give the money to Drew or keep it. If she intervenes, Mikey will get hurt instead and Chloe will hand the money over to Damon, who then leaves. It is now late afternoon and Blackwell begins to start the play. Chloe can find Samantha Myers overhearing Nathan Prescott talking with his father, who wants his son to get over his fear and not humiliate him. Chloe can choose whether to talk to him or keep quiet. She can then convince Samantha to cheer for Nathan and can also encourage Nathan, be sarcastic towards him, or do nothing. Afterwards, she can talk to Hayden Jones, Dana Ward, and Travis Keaton and has the option of playing with the spotlights. In the changing room, Chloe will face a situation between Rachel and Victoria which varies depending on if Rachel was dropped from the play or not. If Rachel was removed from the play, this will lead to either Chloe getting Victoria to drop from the play via backtalk or Rachel drugging Victoria's tea if Chloe was nice to Victoria or lost the backtalk. If Rachel wasn't removed, Victoria will drug Rachel's tea instead. Chloe can either warn Rachel or distract Victoria. If she warns Rachel, she will get Victoria to drink the drugged tea by pretending to believe her. If Chloe distracts Victoria, she will temporally leave and Chloe will switch the cups, leading Victoria to drink the drugged tea upon returning. Keaton later informs the students that Juliet Watson, who was meant to play as Ariel, is delayed by the wildfire that Rachel caused and can't make it in time. Following this, Victoria will then either drop from the play (in which Rachel will then volunteer to take over for Victoria) or fall unconscious. Rachel then convinces a reluctant Chloe to take over for Juliet. As Chloe and Rachel perform onstage as Prospera and Ariel, Nathan then comes in, who will either leave in embarrassment or have confidence and play out his role. Juliet later arrives and replaces Chloe's spot in the play. At the end of the play, Rachel, Hayden, Dana, Juliet, Keaton, and Nathan all come out and bow to the audience, with Rachel bringing Chloe out to join the other performers. The mysterious woman from earlier is seen watching them from a distance. Rachel and Chloe are next seen wandering down a street together. Rachel is happy about the play and how Chloe took part in it. The two then discuss their plan to leave Arcadia Bay, in which Chloe can either receive Rachel's bracelet, a promise for a tattoo, or a kiss. After the conversation, they then head to Rachel's house to pick up clothes. Rachel and Chloe attempt to sneak upstairs but are caught by James. When James compliments her performance, her mood changes, and she despondently replies ""thanks"". Rachel heads upstairs to freshen up, leaving Chloe with her parents. Chloe then helps Rose set up plates and cups for the dinner table, question James of what he wants to drink (in which he will ask for Sherry), and light the candles on the table with her lighter. The four all sit down for dinner and Rachel's parents begin talking about the forest fire and the reports that it was arson. The conversation soon turns into an argument when Rachel's anger visibly increases throughout James's lecture. Chloe can either calm Rachel down or attack James on his misdeeds with her backtalk. Whichever option is chosen, Rachel will lose her temper and call James out. When Chloe and Rose join in the argument, Rachel begins to dissociate and eventually throws a salad bowl through the table, smashing it. She screams at James to tell her the truth. James tells her that the woman he kissed was not his mistress, but is in fact, Rachel's biological mother. The episode ends with scenes showing Steph at the hospital to see Drew and Mikey, Joyce embracing David in despair upon seeing that Chloe hasn't returned, Rachel's biological mother smoking a cigarette, Damon approaching Frank (how they will react depends on whether Chloe gave the money to Damon, Drew, or kept it), Victoria looking at a Tempest poster the dressing room before stepping on it and leaving, Samantha approaching Nathan, and the wildfire still happening in the distance.

[EX]   S0 : CHOICE: (Won backtalk challenge with Frank)  [EX]   CHLOE : I need to find that woman from yesterday, Sera.","Continuing from the last episode where Chloe Price is at Rachel Amber's house for dinner when Rachel accuses her father of cheating, James Amber reveals that the woman he was with in the park was Rachel's real mother, Sera Gearhardt. He then tells them the whole story, in which Chloe and Rachel then find themselves in a dark area with a viewfinder. As James tells the story, they look through the viewfinder, which shows them visuals of how Sera and James met in high school and fell in love. They had a child together (Rachel) but Sera became a drug addict. Growing fearful of Sera's behavior, James eventually left with the child and made an agreement with Sera to pay her monthly if she agreed to stay away. This worked for 15 years. Rachel is devastated and wants to meet Sera, but has no idea how to find her before heading upstairs. Chloe agrees to help (against James's wishes) and goes to Rachel's room, where she finds Rachel laying in bed and is still upset with her father's lies. After using a flashlight from a toolbox and a star globe from a night light to form a starry night, Chloe is able to talk to Rachel, promising to help find Sera. Chloe then has another dream where she is onstage in her Ariel costume on some seats that are arranged to look like car seats. William is sitting in the front row of seats, acting like he is driving. He explains the reason why people keep secrets: to keep their loved ones safe. The dream ends with an actual truck appearing onstage and crushing William, causing Chloe to fall in depression while Victoria can be heard booing her. The next morning, she returns home (in which she may discover that David had searched through her room depending on decisions made in the previous episodes) and calls Frank Bowers, who reluctantly agrees to meet Chloe at the junkyard. While heading downstairs, she sees Joyce and David embracing each other. When she tries to sneak pass them, they see her. David reveals that he has decided to trust Chloe more if she stops taking drugs but despite this, Chloe still refuses to change. David then explains the reason while he's here: his friend Phil Becker had died during their last mission in the army, and he did not want Chloe to suffer the same pain that he had when he lost his friend and hands her a photo of him and Phil. Chloe can choose whether to take the picture or reject it, which will earn David's trust or anger. She then leaves for the junkyard taking her father's toolbox and an old repair manual with her. At the junkyard, Chloe fixes the old truck (requiring repairs on four parts of the engine) and uses a spark plug from the car that was formerly owned by William to finish the repairs. After taking the truck for a test drive, she continues to wait for Frank. Rachel shows up, as does Frank - but he isn't alone. Damon Merrick is here too and demands to know why Chloe is trying to find Sera. Through a conversation, Damon reveals that he knows Sera's whereabouts and learns that Rachel is James Amber's daughter. An altercation takes place (in which Chloe can give Damon the money she took from Drew and Mikey's room if she kept it) and Rachel attacks Damon with a wooden board and is then stabbed in the arm, shocking Chloe and Frank. Frank then hold back Damon while Chloe rushes Rachel to the hospital. Once there, two nurses quickly take her to surgery while Chloe stays in the waiting room. James and Amber later show up and when James asks Chloe what happened, she tearfully tells James the whole story. Chloe can then use this time to talk to Rose, Anthony North (Drew and Mikey's father), the couple from Episode 1, Steph, Drew, and Mikey (with the option of playing one last tabletop game with them). Rachel survives but still wants to find her mother. After James leaves them to talk, she convinces Chloe to break into her dad's office and gives her a code to disarm the alarm. Before leaving, she briefly speaks to Eliot Hampden. She can also eavesdrop on a conversation (or argument) that Samantha's mother is having with either Nathan or Sean in one of the rooms regarding Samantha's injury (presumed to be Nathan's doing). While at James's office, she finds a key hidden in a trophy and uses it to unlock a drawer, which contains evidence showing that James lied about a lot of things and that Damon has Sera. She contacts Damon using James's phone (who, in return, thinks she is James) and has her do some favors: destroy the evidence (which is a glove that Chloe must burn using her lighter and a trash can), finding the snitch (which has to be anyone other than Frank) and showing him the money he promised to give him (which is hidden behind some books on the bookshelf). After all this, he then reveals that Sera is held captive at the old mill. Before she can leave, she is caught by Eliot (who had followed Chloe from the hospital) and closes the door from behind, reactivating the alarm. An argument between the two begins, in which Eliot reveals that he strongly dislikes Rachel and wants Chloe all to himself, while Chloe backtalks against him while trying to call the police by pretending to agree with Eliot. If she wins the backtalk, the police will arrive and Chloe leaves while Eliot stays behind to confront the police. If she loses, Eliot will find out what she's up to, which will make Chloe set off the alarm, forcing Eliot to leave. After escaping, she drives to the old mill. After avoiding a logger truck, she stops near the burnt forest and will speak to an illusion of William, who convinces Chloe to keep going. After arriving at the old mill, she finds Frank's RV and heads into the mill. Optionally, she can find a knife in the mill to use as a weapon against Damon. Chloe confronts Damon, who has Sera tied up in a chair. He reveals that James is paying him to kill Sera and when Chloe tries to stop him, she gets knocked to the ground and is knocked unconscious by him. An injured Frank enters and struggles with Damon, presumably killing him afterwards as Frank got the better of him. Chloe wakes up and talks with Sera, who tries to convince her to not tell Rachel about anything that happened at the mill or her father's corruptive actions (while also believing that she can never be a good mother to Rachel and wishes for her to be with a father who loves her), knowing that it will cause more hurt to Rachel while Chloe tries to convince her to meet Rachel. After the conversation, Sera lets Chloe choose whether she should tell Rachel the truth or not. Chloe can also give Sera Rachel's bracelet if she has it, but she will give it back if Chloe didn't convince her. After Sera leaves, Chloe returns to the hospital and has to decide whether to lie to Rachel (which will cause her to make amends with James) or tell her everything (which will cause her to disown her father and sever ties with him for his wrongdoings). Regardless of her choice, she and Rachel remain friends at the end. The following scenes are then shown (which will all vary depending on Chloe's choices): 1. The Amber family either happily spending time with each other or in disarray. 2. Frank sitting by his RV holding a box of Damon's things. 3. Nathan and Samantha either spending time with each other or drifting apart (if Chloe wasn't supportive of them). 4. Chloe either embracing Joyce and David or still maintaining personal issues towards David. 5. Eliot, whose actions at the Amber house had led to him being expelled, preparing to leave Blackwell and will tear up a photograph of him and Chloe if she lost the backtalk. 6. Steph, Drew, and Mikey playing a tabletop game in front of Blackwell with one of the brothers still recovering from his injuries. The remaining scenes show Chloe and Rachel spending time together. While sitting near the lighthouse, Sera will show up if she was convinced by Chloe to meet Rachel. At the very end of the episode, in the final cinematic, the fate of Rachel Amber is suggested to be similar to that of Victoria and Max's from the first game, where Rachel's phone can be seen ringing inside the underground vault with Chloe being on the other line and the click of a camera can be heard in the background, implying that Rachel is photographed by either Nathan or Jefferson.

while heading downstairs , she sees joyce and david embracing each other .
when she tries to sneak pass them , they see her .
david reveals that he has decided to trust chloe more if she stops taking drugs but despite this , chloe still refuses to change .

while at james 's office , she finds a key hidden in a trophy and uses it to unlock a drawer , which contains evidence showing that james lied about a lot of things and that damon has sera .
she contacts damon using james 's phone ( who , in return , thinks she is james ) and has her do some favors : destroy the evidence ( which is a glove that chloe must burn using her lighter and a trash can ) , finding the snitch ( which has to be anyone other than frank ) and showing him the money he promised to give him ( which is hidden behind some books on the bookshelf ) .
after all this , he then reveals that sera is held captive at the old mill .
before she can leave , she is caught by eliot ( who had followed chloe from the hospital ) and closes the door from behind , reactivating the alarm .
an argument between the two begins , in which eliot reveals that he strongly dislikes rachel and wants chloe all to himself , while chloe backtalks against him while trying to call the police by pretending to agree with eliot .
if she wins the backtalk , the police will arrive and chloe leaves while eliot stays behind to confront the police .
if she loses , eliot will find out what she 's up to , which will make chloe set off the alarm , forcing eliot to leave .
after escaping , she drives to the old mill .
after avoiding a logger truck , she stops near the burnt forest and will speak to an illusion of william , who convinces chloe to keep going .

he reveals that james is paying him to kill sera and when chloe tries to stop him , she gets knocked to the ground and is knocked unconscious by him .
an injured frank enters and struggles with damon , presumably killing him afterwards as frank got the better of him .
chloe wakes up and talks with sera , who tries to convince her to not tell rachel about anything that happened at the mill or her father 's corruptive actions ( while also believing that she can never be a good mother to rachel and wishes for her to be with a father who loves her ) , knowing that it will cause more hurt to rachel while chloe tries to convince her to meet rachel .
after the conversation , sera lets chloe choose whether she should tell rachel the truth or not .
chloe can also give sera rachel 's bracelet if she has it , but she will give it back if chloe did n't convince her .
after sera leaves , chloe returns to the hospital and has to decide whether to lie to rachel ( which will cause her to make amends with james ) or tell her everything ( which will cause her to disown her father and sever ties with him for his wrongdoings ) .
regardless of her choice , she and rachel remain friends at the end .

[EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Rachel looks awesome...","The episode starts with a hooded Chloe Price smoking a cigarette and standing at the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to come. After its passage, she takes off her hood and goes towards the old mill, ignoring the ""No Trespassing"" sign after jumping over a fence. In order to get inside the mill, she starts an argument with the bouncer, in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails. After entering, she can interact with people, objects, graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money (or not). If she steals the money, she'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later. After this, she'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys, the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her. However, she'll manage to see the band by going upstairs, even with the floor there being rotten. She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her. She's saved by Rachel Amber, in her very first appearance, and will have the first major choice of the game: attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing. After running downstairs, the two girls stop and look at Frank, who notices what's going to happen and quickly stops the guys, causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill. Rachel pulls Chloe along with her, and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night. The next morning, Chloe is shown waking up in her room, at the Price household. She sits up and takes her red 'Oregon' ashtray and starts smoking a cigarette (or weed, if she bought it from Frank earlier with the stolen money). Chloe can look at a photo of her and Max Caulfield as kids along with her dad, William Price and can also look at her diary. After being called by her mother, Joyce Price, for breakfast downstairs, she'll get up from her bed and will be able to interact with many objects around her room. She'll change clothes before leaving her room (the player gets to choose her outfit). Due to having drunk too much, Chloe notices her phone is missing. She then goes to her mother's room to call her phone with her mother's phone. There, she can interact with another object before using her mother's phone. By doing this, Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom, and just after she takes it, her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone, causing her to go back to the room. When she finally goes downstairs, she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on. She'll then talk with her mother about several topics, and at the end of the conversation, she'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels. Depending on her choice, Joyce will be either kind or tough towards her. Chloe'll have to pick the keys from her stepfather, David Madsen, and take them to him since he'll be taking her to school today. After leaving the house and going to David, he'll ask her to get the tools he needs to fix his car in the garage. After this, she gets in the car and David will try to start a conversation with her. She can either start a fight with him or listen to what he has to say. After the talk, Chloe will fall asleep and have a weird dream about being in a car with her dad, going to pick up her mom from the grocery store. The dream abruptly ends with a truck crashing through William's car. When she wakes up, she's already at Blackwell Academy. There, she can talk to Eliot Hampden (and choose whether or not she wants to watch The Tempest play with him), Victoria Chase (with the option of sabotaging her homework if doing so), Skip Matthews (with the option of listening to the demo of his band, PissHead, and giving him your opinion on it if doing so), Principal Wells (only if she sits on a crate on the stage and with the option of starting a backtalk challenge with him if doing so), Michelle Grant, Mikey North and Steph Gingrich (in order to get her DVD and with the additional option of playing a tabletop game with them), and other students. Afterwards, she'll go towards the school entrance, but she'll be interrupted by Drew North and Nathan Prescott, who are starting a fight. A student called Samantha Myers urges Chloe to do something to help Nathan, and Chloe can either backtalk Drew and defend Nathan or just ignore them, which will cause Samantha to either thank Chloe or be upset with her for not helping. When the fight is over, she can finally enter the school, and just as she opens the door, Rachel appears on the other side and pulls her along with her to the Drama Lab where Travis Keaton is rehearsing with Dana Ward and Hayden Jones. Rachel will ask for her opinion on Miranda's love for Fernando, both portrayed by Dana and Hayden respectively in ""The Tempest"" play, and Chloe can choose whether to say it's true love or not. After the class is over, everyone will leave the room, except for Chloe and Rachel. Rachel will change to normal clothes and ask Chloe to get her belt from her bag and bring it to her. After doing this, they'll have a short conversation before Rachel invites Chloe to skip school, and they end up in a train carriage where, after finding some crates to sit on, they play the game Two Truths and a Lie. Chloe can either cheat or follow the game rules. After their game, Chloe will have the option of sharing or not her earbuds with Rachel during their trip. Upon arriving at Overlook Park, they'll play another game using the viewfinders to spy on people around the park. However, the viewfinder that they intend to use it broken. Chloe asks Rachel for something sharp like a knife and she gives her a nail file, which Chloe uses to unscrew a deducation plate from a park bench and then uses it to break open the viewfinder, allowing them to use it for free. When they get a closer view of the last couple available, a man and a woman under a tree, Rachel gets distressed when they start kissing and puts an end to their game, telling Chloe she needs to get drunk. They'll then go to the other side of the park, where a couple is having a picnic and have a bottle of wine on their table. Rachel approaches the couple and starts acting sick, throwing herself to the ground and pretending to be in need of resuscitation. Chloe can encourage the man to help her, either succeeding or failing on doing so resulting in the man ""saving"" Rachel's life or the woman seeing through their ploy. Whatever the outcome is, the two girls will get the wine. After this, they're shown walking on the train tracks. Chloe invites Rachel to explore a junkyard nearby and Rachel lets her explore on her own. After a long conversation between the two, no matter what choices the player has made so far, Rachel will leave, but not before Chloe tries to convince her to stay. Chloe has the option to say that they have a real friendship or something more. Once Rachel leaves, Chloe gets angry and breaks everything around her. She then has a meltdown upon seeing her late father's car. She'll fall asleep and have another dream about her father, this time, with him advising/warning her on her relationship with Rachel, in which Chloe will see Rachel outside of the car, who will then catch fire. When she wakes up, it's already night and she goes back to the overlook where she finds Rachel. Upon a brief dialogue, in which Rachel reveals the man they had seen at the park was her dad, and that he was cheating on her mother with that woman. Rachel takes out a photo of her as a kid with her father, asks Chloe for her lighter which she uses it burn the photo, throwing it into a nearby trash bin, and starting a wildfire by kicking the bin into a tree nearby. Rachel then screams, increasing the fire's intensity. The episode ends showing each character's reaction to the wildfire seen in the sky.

In order to get inside the mill , she starts an argument with the bouncer , in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails .
After entering , she can interact with people , objects , graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money ( or not ) .
If she steals the money , she 'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later .
After this , she 'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that 's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys , the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her .
However , she 'll manage to see the band by going upstairs , even with the floor there being rotten .
She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her .
She 's saved by Rachel Amber , in her very first appearance , and will have the first major choice of the game : attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing .
After running downstairs , the two girls stop and look at Frank , who notices what 's going to happen and quickly stops the guys , causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill .
Rachel pulls Chloe along with her , and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night .
The next morning , Chloe is shown waking up in her room , at the Price household .

There , she can interact with another object before using her mother 's phone .
By doing this , Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom , and just after she takes it , her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone , causing her to go back to the room .
When she finally goes downstairs , she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on .
She 'll then talk with her mother about several topics , and at the end of the conversation , she 'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels .

Afterwards , she 'll go towards the school entrance , but she 'll be interrupted by Drew North and Nathan Prescott , who are starting a fight .
A student called Samantha Myers urges Chloe to do something to help Nathan , and Chloe can either backtalk Drew and defend Nathan or just ignore them , which will cause Samantha to either thank Chloe or be upset with her for not helping .
When the fight is over , she can finally enter the school , and just as she opens the door , Rachel appears on the other side and pulls her along with her to the Drama Lab where Travis Keaton is rehearsing with Dana Ward and Hayden Jones .

After the class is over , everyone will leave the room , except for Chloe and Rachel .
Rachel will change to normal clothes and ask Chloe to get her belt from her bag and bring it to her .

[EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Rachel would want to know more.","Episode 2: Brave New World begins with Rachel Amber and Chloe Price in Principal Wells' office. Both Rachel and Chloe are questioned about their absence the day before. The conversation varies depending on how Chloe treated Joyce, if she sabotaged Victoria's homework, if she went onstage and smoked weed, whether she helped Nathan or not, and if she won or lost the backtalk against Drew (if she helped Nathan). Rachel claims their misbehavior was her idea, and as punishment, is removed as Wells' administrative assistant and her role as Prospera in The Tempest. If Chloe goes along with Rachel, she will be suspended. If Chloe takes the blame for Rachel, she will be expelled, but Rachel won't be removed from the play. After they leave the office, Skip Matthews escorts Chloe to her locker, so she can clean it out. Chloe searches for her hidden joint but discovers Justin Williams has taken it. Angry, Chloe lies to Skip that she has to use the bathroom. Meanwhile, Joyce speaks with Rachel's parents, James, and Rose Amber. Once inside, she proceeds to tag it from ceiling to floor, venting her frustration. She then exits and Victoria approaches the bathroom, looking dumbfounded as she opens the door. Chloe enters the parking lot of Blackwell Academy. She can optionally talk to Eliot, who will feel sympathy for her expulsion or suspension and offer her a hug. He will again ask her if she wants to go to the play with him. Chloe walks to the car where Joyce and David are waiting for her; David asks her to empty her pockets on the hood of the car. David later announces that he will be moving in with them. This outrages Chloe and she storms off. David stops Joyce from going after her, wanting to give her some time to get over her anger. Chloe goes to the junkyard and knocks over items with her bat until she notices a very old truck. She scours the junkyard for various items needed to fix the truck: a battery from an impounded truck (which requires having to press a button to unlock the hood); something to cover the hole in the floor: a rug, a welcome mat, or a golf mat; a new light bulb from either a fish tank, a toy robot, or a Christmas wreath; and something to cover the torn seat: a pirate flag or a beach towel. She can also optionally decorate the truck using an Elvis Presley bobblehead found in a small box somewhere in the junkyard and draw a decoration on the back of the seat. Despite all her hard work, the truck still remains inoperational. She then relaxes in the driver's seat and smokes a cigarette. Chloe finds herself in another one of her dreams. She finds William, her deceased father, roasting marshmallows in the burning wreckage of his car. She sits next to him and roasts marshmallows too, as he warns her about the danger of fire, a metaphor for Rachel Amber. The dream ends with William's face being shown half-burnt with a raven pecking at his face. Chloe wakes up to find Rachel tapping on the window of her car, carrying a duffel bag. Rachel gets inside the car and the two have a ""therapy session"" (which will vary depending on if Rachel was removed from the play or not): they discuss their feelings about the current events in their life and how unhappy they are with them. Rachel leaves and gives Chloe her duffel bag, which is full of clothes. Chloe receives a call from Frank Bowers, who wants to meet up with her. Chloe enters the Hideout in the junkyard. She can optionally spruce up the place and then changes into one of Rachel's outfits. Frank approaches in his RV. Chloe sees a woman leaving the vehicle. She enters Frank's RV and he drives away. He asks her to retrieve his account book. Chloe opens the door to his bedroom, and Pompidou runs out. She takes his account book and brings it to him. Chloe then asks Frank about the woman, but he refuses to say anything. Frank reveals that Drew North runs Oxy for Damon Merrick and he owes him $1,000. He asks her to go to the school to find the money and bring it to him. After Frank drops off Chloe, she can speak with Steph Gingrich, Evan Harris, and Samuel Taylor. She shoos away a bird that Evan is photographing to distract him long enough for Chloe to damage a nearby sprinkler. This gets Samuel's attention and while he goes to fix the sprinkler, Chloe takes his keys and uses it to unlock the dorm, but encounters Skip. An argument begins, which will earn either Skip's trust or anger before he leaves to deal with an unauthorized vehicle in the parking lot (presumably Frank's RV). After she enters Drew and Mikey's room, she must figure out the combination to a locked trunk containing the money. If she fails too many times, she will get help from Steph. After getting the money, she is caught by Mikey and Drew (who are preparing to leave), followed by the arrival of Damon. Drew goes out to talk to him while telling Chloe not to leave the room. Upon hearing Damon beat up Drew, Chloe must choose whether to intervene or stay in the room, which will lead Drew to be glad for staying out of the way or upset for interfering. If she stays out of the fight, Drew will get injured and after Damon leaves, Chloe must choose to give the money to Drew or keep it. If she intervenes, Mikey will get hurt instead and Chloe will hand the money over to Damon, who then leaves. It is now late afternoon and Blackwell begins to start the play. Chloe can find Samantha Myers overhearing Nathan Prescott talking with his father, who wants his son to get over his fear and not humiliate him. Chloe can choose whether to talk to him or keep quiet. She can then convince Samantha to cheer for Nathan and can also encourage Nathan, be sarcastic towards him, or do nothing. Afterwards, she can talk to Hayden Jones, Dana Ward, and Travis Keaton and has the option of playing with the spotlights. In the changing room, Chloe will face a situation between Rachel and Victoria which varies depending on if Rachel was dropped from the play or not. If Rachel was removed from the play, this will lead to either Chloe getting Victoria to drop from the play via backtalk or Rachel drugging Victoria's tea if Chloe was nice to Victoria or lost the backtalk. If Rachel wasn't removed, Victoria will drug Rachel's tea instead. Chloe can either warn Rachel or distract Victoria. If she warns Rachel, she will get Victoria to drink the drugged tea by pretending to believe her. If Chloe distracts Victoria, she will temporally leave and Chloe will switch the cups, leading Victoria to drink the drugged tea upon returning. Keaton later informs the students that Juliet Watson, who was meant to play as Ariel, is delayed by the wildfire that Rachel caused and can't make it in time. Following this, Victoria will then either drop from the play (in which Rachel will then volunteer to take over for Victoria) or fall unconscious. Rachel then convinces a reluctant Chloe to take over for Juliet. As Chloe and Rachel perform onstage as Prospera and Ariel, Nathan then comes in, who will either leave in embarrassment or have confidence and play out his role. Juliet later arrives and replaces Chloe's spot in the play. At the end of the play, Rachel, Hayden, Dana, Juliet, Keaton, and Nathan all come out and bow to the audience, with Rachel bringing Chloe out to join the other performers. The mysterious woman from earlier is seen watching them from a distance. Rachel and Chloe are next seen wandering down a street together. Rachel is happy about the play and how Chloe took part in it. The two then discuss their plan to leave Arcadia Bay, in which Chloe can either receive Rachel's bracelet, a promise for a tattoo, or a kiss. After the conversation, they then head to Rachel's house to pick up clothes. Rachel and Chloe attempt to sneak upstairs but are caught by James. When James compliments her performance, her mood changes, and she despondently replies ""thanks"". Rachel heads upstairs to freshen up, leaving Chloe with her parents. Chloe then helps Rose set up plates and cups for the dinner table, question James of what he wants to drink (in which he will ask for Sherry), and light the candles on the table with her lighter. The four all sit down for dinner and Rachel's parents begin talking about the forest fire and the reports that it was arson. The conversation soon turns into an argument when Rachel's anger visibly increases throughout James's lecture. Chloe can either calm Rachel down or attack James on his misdeeds with her backtalk. Whichever option is chosen, Rachel will lose her temper and call James out. When Chloe and Rose join in the argument, Rachel begins to dissociate and eventually throws a salad bowl through the table, smashing it. She screams at James to tell her the truth. James tells her that the woman he kissed was not his mistress, but is in fact, Rachel's biological mother. The episode ends with scenes showing Steph at the hospital to see Drew and Mikey, Joyce embracing David in despair upon seeing that Chloe hasn't returned, Rachel's biological mother smoking a cigarette, Damon approaching Frank (how they will react depends on whether Chloe gave the money to Damon, Drew, or kept it), Victoria looking at a Tempest poster the dressing room before stepping on it and leaving, Samantha approaching Nathan, and the wildfire still happening in the distance.

After its passage, she takes off her hood and goes towards the old mill, ignoring the ""No Trespassing"" sign after jumping over a fence. In order to get inside the mill, she starts an argument with the bouncer, in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails. After entering, she can interact with people, objects, graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money (or not). If she steals the money, she'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later. After this, she'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys, the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her. However, she'll manage to see the band by going upstairs, even with the floor there being rotten. She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her. She's saved by Rachel Amber, in her very first appearance, and will have the first major choice of the game: attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing. After running downstairs, the two girls stop and look at Frank, who notices what's going to happen and quickly stops the guys, causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill. Rachel pulls Chloe along with her, and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night. The next morning, Chloe is shown waking up in her room, at the Price household. She sits up and takes her red 'Oregon' ashtray and starts smoking a cigarette (or weed, if she bought it from Frank earlier with the stolen money). Chloe can look at a photo of her and Max Caulfield as kids along with her dad, William Price and can also look at her diary. After being called by her mother, Joyce Price, for breakfast downstairs, she'll get up from her bed and will be able to interact with many objects around her room. She'll change clothes before leaving her room (the player gets to choose her outfit). Due to having drunk too much, Chloe notices her phone is missing. She then goes to her mother's room to call her phone with her mother's phone. There, she can interact with another object before using her mother's phone. By doing this, Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom, and just after she takes it, her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone, causing her to go back to the room. When she finally goes downstairs, she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on. She'll then talk with her mother about several topics, and at the end of the conversation, she'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels. Depending on her choice, Joyce will be either kind or tough towards her. Chloe'll have to pick the keys from her stepfather, David Madsen, and take them to him since he'll be taking her to school today. After leaving the house and going to David, he'll ask her to get the tools he needs to fix his car in the garage. After this, she gets in the car and David will try to start a conversation with her. She can either start a fight with him or listen to what he has to say. After the talk, Chloe will fall asleep and have a weird dream about being in a car with her dad, going to pick up her mom from the grocery store. The dream abruptly ends with a truck crashing through William's car. When she wakes up, she's already at Blackwell Academy. There, she can talk to Eliot Hampden (and choose whether or not she wants to watch The Tempest play with him), Victoria Chase (with the option of sabotaging her homework if doing so), Skip Matthews (with the option of listening to the demo of his band, PissHead, and giving him your opinion on it if doing so), Principal Wells (only if she sits on a crate on the stage and with the option of starting a backtalk challenge with him if doing so), Michelle Grant, Mikey North and Steph Gingrich (in order to get her DVD and with the additional option of playing a tabletop game with them), and other students. Afterwards, she'll go towards the school entrance, but she'll be interrupted by Drew North and Nathan Prescott, who are starting a fight. A student called Samantha Myers urges Chloe to do something to help Nathan, and Chloe can either backtalk Drew and defend Nathan or just ignore them, which will cause Samantha to either thank Chloe or be upset with her for not helping. When the fight is over, she can finally enter the school, and just as she opens the door, Rachel appears on the other side and pulls her along with her to the Drama Lab where Travis Keaton is rehearsing with Dana Ward and Hayden Jones. Rachel will ask for her opinion on Miranda's love for Fernando, both portrayed by Dana and Hayden respectively in ""The Tempest"" play, and Chloe can choose whether to say it's true love or not. After the class is over, everyone will leave the room, except for Chloe and Rachel. Rachel will change to normal clothes and ask Chloe to get her belt from her bag and bring it to her. After doing this, they'll have a short conversation before Rachel invites Chloe to skip school, and they end up in a train carriage where, after finding some crates to sit on, they play the game Two Truths and a Lie. Chloe can either cheat or follow the game rules. After their game, Chloe will have the option of sharing or not her earbuds with Rachel during their trip. Upon arriving at Overlook Park, they'll play another game using the viewfinders to spy on people around the park. However, the viewfinder that they intend to use it broken.

They'll then go to the other side of the park, where a couple is having a picnic and have a bottle of wine on their table. Rachel approaches the couple and starts acting sick, throwing herself to the ground and pretending to be in need of resuscitation. Chloe can encourage the man to help her, either succeeding or failing on doing so resulting in the man ""saving"" Rachel's life or the woman seeing through their ploy. Whatever the outcome is, the two girls will get the wine. After this, they're shown walking on the train tracks. Chloe invites Rachel to explore a junkyard nearby and Rachel lets her explore on her own. After a long conversation between the two, no matter what choices the player has made so far, Rachel will leave, but not before Chloe tries to convince her to stay. Chloe has the option to say that they have a real friendship or something more. Once Rachel leaves, Chloe gets angry and breaks everything around her. She then has a meltdown upon seeing her late father's car. She'll fall asleep and have another dream about her father, this time, with him advising/warning her on her relationship with Rachel, in which Chloe will see Rachel outside of the car, who will then catch fire. When she wakes up, it's already night and she goes back to the overlook where she finds Rachel.

Both Rachel and Chloe are questioned about their absence the day before. The conversation varies depending on how Chloe treated Joyce, if she sabotaged Victoria's homework, if she went onstage and smoked weed, whether she helped Nathan or not, and if she won or lost the backtalk against Drew (if she helped Nathan). Rachel claims their misbehavior was her idea, and as punishment, is removed as Wells' administrative assistant and her role as Prospera in The Tempest. If Chloe goes along with Rachel, she will be suspended. If Chloe takes the blame for Rachel, she will be expelled, but Rachel won't be removed from the play. After they leave the office, Skip Matthews escorts Chloe to her locker, so she can clean it out. Chloe searches for her hidden joint but discovers Justin Williams has taken it. Angry, Chloe lies to Skip that she has to use the bathroom. Meanwhile, Joyce speaks with Rachel's parents, James, and Rose Amber. Once inside, she proceeds to tag it from ceiling to floor, venting her frustration. She then exits and Victoria approaches the bathroom, looking dumbfounded as she opens the door. Chloe enters the parking lot of Blackwell Academy. She can optionally talk to Eliot, who will feel sympathy for her expulsion or suspension and offer her a hug. He will again ask her if she wants to go to the play with him. Chloe walks to the car where Joyce and David are waiting for her; David asks her to empty her pockets on the hood of the car. David later announces that he will be moving in with them. This outrages Chloe and she storms off. David stops Joyce from going after her, wanting to give her some time to get over her anger. Chloe goes to the junkyard and knocks over items with her bat until she notices a very old truck. She scours the junkyard for various items needed to fix the truck: a battery from an impounded truck (which requires having to press a button to unlock the hood); something to cover the hole in the floor: a rug, a welcome mat, or a golf mat; a new light bulb from either a fish tank, a toy robot, or a Christmas wreath; and something to cover the torn seat: a pirate flag or a beach towel. She can also optionally decorate the truck using an Elvis Presley bobblehead found in a small box somewhere in the junkyard and draw a decoration on the back of the seat. Despite all her hard work, the truck still remains inoperational. She then relaxes in the driver's seat and smokes a cigarette. Chloe finds herself in another one of her dreams. She finds William, her deceased father, roasting marshmallows in the burning wreckage of his car. She sits next to him and roasts marshmallows too, as he warns her about the danger of fire, a metaphor for Rachel Amber. The dream ends with William's face being shown half-burnt with a raven pecking at his face. Chloe wakes up to find Rachel tapping on the window of her car, carrying a duffel bag. Rachel gets inside the car and the two have a ""therapy session"" (which will vary depending on if Rachel was removed from the play or not): they discuss their feelings about the current events in their life and how unhappy they are with them. Rachel leaves and gives Chloe her duffel bag, which is full of clothes. Chloe receives a call from Frank Bowers, who wants to meet up with her. Chloe enters the Hideout in the junkyard. She can optionally spruce up the place and then changes into one of Rachel's outfits. Frank approaches in his RV. Chloe sees a woman leaving the vehicle. She enters Frank's RV and he drives away. He asks her to retrieve his account book. Chloe opens the door to his bedroom, and Pompidou runs out. She takes his account book and brings it to him. Chloe then asks Frank about the woman, but he refuses to say anything. Frank reveals that Drew North runs Oxy for Damon Merrick and he owes him $1,000. He asks her to go to the school to find the money and bring it to him. After Frank drops off Chloe, she can speak with Steph Gingrich, Evan Harris, and Samuel Taylor. She shoos away a bird that Evan is photographing to distract him long enough for Chloe to damage a nearby sprinkler. This gets Samuel's attention and while he goes to fix the sprinkler, Chloe takes his keys and uses it to unlock the dorm, but encounters Skip. An argument begins, which will earn either Skip's trust or anger before he leaves to deal with an unauthorized vehicle in the parking lot (presumably Frank's RV). After she enters Drew and Mikey's room, she must figure out the combination to a locked trunk containing the money. If she fails too many times, she will get help from Steph. After getting the money, she is caught by Mikey and Drew (who are preparing to leave), followed by the arrival of Damon. Drew goes out to talk to him while telling Chloe not to leave the room. Upon hearing Damon beat up Drew, Chloe must choose whether to intervene or stay in the room, which will lead Drew to be glad for staying out of the way or upset for interfering. If she stays out of the fight, Drew will get injured and after Damon leaves, Chloe must choose to give the money to Drew or keep it. If she intervenes, Mikey will get hurt instead and Chloe will hand the money over to Damon, who then leaves. It is now late afternoon and Blackwell begins to start the play. Chloe can find Samantha Myers overhearing Nathan Prescott talking with his father, who wants his son to get over his fear and not humiliate him. Chloe can choose whether to talk to him or keep quiet. She can then convince Samantha to cheer for Nathan and can also encourage Nathan, be sarcastic towards him, or do nothing. Afterwards, she can talk to Hayden Jones, Dana Ward, and Travis Keaton and has the option of playing with the spotlights. In the changing room, Chloe will face a situation between Rachel and Victoria which varies depending on if Rachel was dropped from the play or not. If Rachel was removed from the play, this will lead to either Chloe getting Victoria to drop from the play via backtalk or Rachel drugging Victoria's tea if Chloe was nice to Victoria or lost the backtalk. If Rachel wasn't removed, Victoria will drug Rachel's tea instead. Chloe can either warn Rachel or distract Victoria. If she warns Rachel, she will get Victoria to drink the drugged tea by pretending to believe her. If Chloe distracts Victoria, she will temporally leave and Chloe will switch the cups, leading Victoria to drink the drugged tea upon returning. Keaton later informs the students that Juliet Watson, who was meant to play as Ariel, is delayed by the wildfire that Rachel caused and can't make it in time. Following this, Victoria will then either drop from the play (in which Rachel will then volunteer to take over for Victoria) or fall unconscious. Rachel then convinces a reluctant Chloe to take over for Juliet. As Chloe and Rachel perform onstage as Prospera and Ariel, Nathan then comes in, who will either leave in embarrassment or have confidence and play out his role. Juliet later arrives and replaces Chloe's spot in the play. At the end of the play, Rachel, Hayden, Dana, Juliet, Keaton, and Nathan all come out and bow to the audience, with Rachel bringing Chloe out to join the other performers. The mysterious woman from earlier is seen watching them from a distance. Rachel and Chloe are next seen wandering down a street together. Rachel is happy about the play and how Chloe took part in it. The two then discuss their plan to leave Arcadia Bay, in which Chloe can either receive Rachel's bracelet, a promise for a tattoo, or a kiss. After the conversation, they then head to Rachel's house to pick up clothes. Rachel and Chloe attempt to sneak upstairs but are caught by James. When James compliments her performance, her mood changes, and she despondently replies ""thanks"". Rachel heads upstairs to freshen up, leaving Chloe with her parents. Chloe then helps Rose set up plates and cups for the dinner table, question James of what he wants to drink (in which he will ask for Sherry), and light the candles on the table with her lighter. The four all sit down for dinner and Rachel's parents begin talking about the forest fire and the reports that it was arson. The conversation soon turns into an argument when Rachel's anger visibly increases throughout James's lecture. Chloe can either calm Rachel down or attack James on his misdeeds with her backtalk. Whichever option is chosen, Rachel will lose her temper and call James out. When Chloe and Rose join in the argument, Rachel begins to dissociate and eventually throws a salad bowl through the table, smashing it. She screams at James to tell her the truth. James tells her that the woman he kissed was not his mistress, but is in fact, Rachel's biological mother. The episode ends with scenes showing Steph at the hospital to see Drew and Mikey, Joyce embracing David in despair upon seeing that Chloe hasn't returned, Rachel's biological mother smoking a cigarette, Damon approaching Frank (how they will react depends on whether Chloe gave the money to Damon, Drew, or kept it), Victoria looking at a Tempest poster the dressing room before stepping on it and leaving, Samantha approaching Nathan, and the wildfire still happening in the distance.

[EX]   S0 : CHOICE: (Won backtalk challenge with Frank)  [EX]   CHLOE : I need to find that woman from yesterday, Sera.","Continuing from the last episode where Chloe Price is at Rachel Amber's house for dinner when Rachel accuses her father of cheating, James Amber reveals that the woman he was with in the park was Rachel's real mother, Sera Gearhardt. He then tells them the whole story, in which Chloe and Rachel then find themselves in a dark area with a viewfinder. As James tells the story, they look through the viewfinder, which shows them visuals of how Sera and James met in high school and fell in love. They had a child together (Rachel) but Sera became a drug addict. Growing fearful of Sera's behavior, James eventually left with the child and made an agreement with Sera to pay her monthly if she agreed to stay away. This worked for 15 years. Rachel is devastated and wants to meet Sera, but has no idea how to find her before heading upstairs. Chloe agrees to help (against James's wishes) and goes to Rachel's room, where she finds Rachel laying in bed and is still upset with her father's lies. After using a flashlight from a toolbox and a star globe from a night light to form a starry night, Chloe is able to talk to Rachel, promising to help find Sera. Chloe then has another dream where she is onstage in her Ariel costume on some seats that are arranged to look like car seats. William is sitting in the front row of seats, acting like he is driving. He explains the reason why people keep secrets: to keep their loved ones safe. The dream ends with an actual truck appearing onstage and crushing William, causing Chloe to fall in depression while Victoria can be heard booing her. The next morning, she returns home (in which she may discover that David had searched through her room depending on decisions made in the previous episodes) and calls Frank Bowers, who reluctantly agrees to meet Chloe at the junkyard. While heading downstairs, she sees Joyce and David embracing each other. When she tries to sneak pass them, they see her. David reveals that he has decided to trust Chloe more if she stops taking drugs but despite this, Chloe still refuses to change. David then explains the reason while he's here: his friend Phil Becker had died during their last mission in the army, and he did not want Chloe to suffer the same pain that he had when he lost his friend and hands her a photo of him and Phil. Chloe can choose whether to take the picture or reject it, which will earn David's trust or anger. She then leaves for the junkyard taking her father's toolbox and an old repair manual with her. At the junkyard, Chloe fixes the old truck (requiring repairs on four parts of the engine) and uses a spark plug from the car that was formerly owned by William to finish the repairs. After taking the truck for a test drive, she continues to wait for Frank. Rachel shows up, as does Frank - but he isn't alone. Damon Merrick is here too and demands to know why Chloe is trying to find Sera. Through a conversation, Damon reveals that he knows Sera's whereabouts and learns that Rachel is James Amber's daughter. An altercation takes place (in which Chloe can give Damon the money she took from Drew and Mikey's room if she kept it) and Rachel attacks Damon with a wooden board and is then stabbed in the arm, shocking Chloe and Frank. Frank then hold back Damon while Chloe rushes Rachel to the hospital. Once there, two nurses quickly take her to surgery while Chloe stays in the waiting room. James and Amber later show up and when James asks Chloe what happened, she tearfully tells James the whole story. Chloe can then use this time to talk to Rose, Anthony North (Drew and Mikey's father), the couple from Episode 1, Steph, Drew, and Mikey (with the option of playing one last tabletop game with them). Rachel survives but still wants to find her mother. After James leaves them to talk, she convinces Chloe to break into her dad's office and gives her a code to disarm the alarm. Before leaving, she briefly speaks to Eliot Hampden. She can also eavesdrop on a conversation (or argument) that Samantha's mother is having with either Nathan or Sean in one of the rooms regarding Samantha's injury (presumed to be Nathan's doing). While at James's office, she finds a key hidden in a trophy and uses it to unlock a drawer, which contains evidence showing that James lied about a lot of things and that Damon has Sera. She contacts Damon using James's phone (who, in return, thinks she is James) and has her do some favors: destroy the evidence (which is a glove that Chloe must burn using her lighter and a trash can), finding the snitch (which has to be anyone other than Frank) and showing him the money he promised to give him (which is hidden behind some books on the bookshelf). After all this, he then reveals that Sera is held captive at the old mill. Before she can leave, she is caught by Eliot (who had followed Chloe from the hospital) and closes the door from behind, reactivating the alarm. An argument between the two begins, in which Eliot reveals that he strongly dislikes Rachel and wants Chloe all to himself, while Chloe backtalks against him while trying to call the police by pretending to agree with Eliot. If she wins the backtalk, the police will arrive and Chloe leaves while Eliot stays behind to confront the police. If she loses, Eliot will find out what she's up to, which will make Chloe set off the alarm, forcing Eliot to leave. After escaping, she drives to the old mill. After avoiding a logger truck, she stops near the burnt forest and will speak to an illusion of William, who convinces Chloe to keep going. After arriving at the old mill, she finds Frank's RV and heads into the mill. Optionally, she can find a knife in the mill to use as a weapon against Damon. Chloe confronts Damon, who has Sera tied up in a chair. He reveals that James is paying him to kill Sera and when Chloe tries to stop him, she gets knocked to the ground and is knocked unconscious by him. An injured Frank enters and struggles with Damon, presumably killing him afterwards as Frank got the better of him. Chloe wakes up and talks with Sera, who tries to convince her to not tell Rachel about anything that happened at the mill or her father's corruptive actions (while also believing that she can never be a good mother to Rachel and wishes for her to be with a father who loves her), knowing that it will cause more hurt to Rachel while Chloe tries to convince her to meet Rachel. After the conversation, Sera lets Chloe choose whether she should tell Rachel the truth or not. Chloe can also give Sera Rachel's bracelet if she has it, but she will give it back if Chloe didn't convince her. After Sera leaves, Chloe returns to the hospital and has to decide whether to lie to Rachel (which will cause her to make amends with James) or tell her everything (which will cause her to disown her father and sever ties with him for his wrongdoings). Regardless of her choice, she and Rachel remain friends at the end. The following scenes are then shown (which will all vary depending on Chloe's choices): 1. The Amber family either happily spending time with each other or in disarray. 2. Frank sitting by his RV holding a box of Damon's things. 3. Nathan and Samantha either spending time with each other or drifting apart (if Chloe wasn't supportive of them). 4. Chloe either embracing Joyce and David or still maintaining personal issues towards David. 5. Eliot, whose actions at the Amber house had led to him being expelled, preparing to leave Blackwell and will tear up a photograph of him and Chloe if she lost the backtalk. 6. Steph, Drew, and Mikey playing a tabletop game in front of Blackwell with one of the brothers still recovering from his injuries. The remaining scenes show Chloe and Rachel spending time together. While sitting near the lighthouse, Sera will show up if she was convinced by Chloe to meet Rachel. At the very end of the episode, in the final cinematic, the fate of Rachel Amber is suggested to be similar to that of Victoria and Max's from the first game, where Rachel's phone can be seen ringing inside the underground vault with Chloe being on the other line and the click of a camera can be heard in the background, implying that Rachel is photographed by either Nathan or Jefferson.

rachel survives but still wants to find her mother .
after james leaves them to talk , she convinces chloe to break into her dad 's office and gives her a code to disarm the alarm .
before leaving , she briefly speaks to eliot hampden .
she can also eavesdrop on a conversation ( or argument ) that samantha 's mother is having with either nathan or sean in one of the rooms regarding samantha 's injury ( presumed to be nathan 's doing ) .
while at james 's office , she finds a key hidden in a trophy and uses it to unlock a drawer , which contains evidence showing that james lied about a lot of things and that damon has sera .
she contacts damon using james 's phone ( who , in return , thinks she is james ) and has her do some favors : destroy the evidence ( which is a glove that chloe must burn using her lighter and a trash can ) , finding the snitch ( which has to be anyone other than frank ) and showing him the money he promised to give him ( which is hidden behind some books on the bookshelf ) .
after all this , he then reveals that sera is held captive at the old mill .
before she can leave , she is caught by eliot ( who had followed chloe from the hospital ) and closes the door from behind , reactivating the alarm .
an argument between the two begins , in which eliot reveals that he strongly dislikes rachel and wants chloe all to himself , while chloe backtalks against him while trying to call the police by pretending to agree with eliot .
if she wins the backtalk , the police will arrive and chloe leaves while eliot stays behind to confront the police .
if she loses , eliot will find out what she 's up to , which will make chloe set off the alarm , forcing eliot to leave .
after escaping , she drives to the old mill .
after avoiding a logger truck , she stops near the burnt forest and will speak to an illusion of william , who convinces chloe to keep going .
after arriving at the old mill , she finds frank 's rv and heads into the mill .

chloe confronts damon , who has sera tied up in a chair .
he reveals that james is paying him to kill sera and when chloe tries to stop him , she gets knocked to the ground and is knocked unconscious by him .
an injured frank enters and struggles with damon , presumably killing him afterwards as frank got the better of him .
chloe wakes up and talks with sera , who tries to convince her to not tell rachel about anything that happened at the mill or her father 's corruptive actions ( while also believing that she can never be a good mother to rachel and wishes for her to be with a father who loves her ) , knowing that it will cause more hurt to rachel while chloe tries to convince her to meet rachel .
after the conversation , sera lets chloe choose whether she should tell rachel the truth or not .
chloe can also give sera rachel 's bracelet if she has it , but she will give it back if chloe did n't convince her .
after sera leaves , chloe returns to the hospital and has to decide whether to lie to rachel ( which will cause her to make amends with james ) or tell her everything ( which will cause her to disown her father and sever ties with him for his wrongdoings ) .
regardless of her choice , she and rachel remain friends at the end .

Chloe can then use this time to talk to Rose , Anthony North ( Drew and Mikey 's father ) , the couple from Episode 1 , Steph , Drew , and Mikey ( with the option of playing one last tabletop game with them ) .
Rachel survives but still wants to find her mother .
After James leaves them to talk , she convinces Chloe to break into her dad 's office and gives her a code to disarm the alarm .
Before leaving , she briefly speaks to Eliot Hampden .
She can also eavesdrop on a conversation ( or argument ) that Samantha 's mother is having with either Nathan or Sean in one of the rooms regarding Samantha 's injury ( presumed to be Nathan 's doing ) .
While at James 's office , she finds a key hidden in a trophy and uses it to unlock a drawer , which contains evidence showing that James lied about a lot of things and that Damon has Sera .
She contacts Damon using James 's phone ( who , in return , thinks she is James ) and has her do some favors : destroy the evidence ( which is a glove that Chloe must burn using her lighter and a trash can ) , finding the snitch ( which has to be anyone other than Frank ) and showing him the money he promised to give him ( which is hidden behind some books on the bookshelf ) .
After all this , he then reveals that Sera is held captive at the old mill .
Before she can leave , she is caught by Eliot ( who had followed Chloe from the hospital ) and closes the door from behind , reactivating the alarm .
An argument between the two begins , in which Eliot reveals that he strongly dislikes Rachel and wants Chloe all to himself , while Chloe backtalks against him while trying to call the police by pretending to agree with Eliot .
If she wins the backtalk , the police will arrive and Chloe leaves while Eliot stays behind to confront the police .
If she loses , Eliot will find out what she 's up to , which will make Chloe set off the alarm , forcing Eliot to leave .
After escaping , she drives to the old mill .
After avoiding a logger truck , she stops near the burnt forest and will speak to an illusion of William , who convinces Chloe to keep going .
After arriving at the old mill , she finds Frank 's RV and heads into the mill .
Optionally , she can find a knife in the mill to use as a weapon against Damon .
Chloe confronts Damon , who has Sera tied up in a chair .
He reveals that James is paying him to kill Sera and when Chloe tries to stop him , she gets knocked to the ground and is knocked unconscious by him .
An injured Frank enters and struggles with Damon , presumably killing him afterwards as Frank got the better of him .
Chloe wakes up and talks with Sera , who tries to convince her to not tell Rachel about anything that happened at the mill or her father 's corruptive actions ( while also believing that she can never be a good mother to Rachel and wishes for her to be with a father who loves her ) , knowing that it will cause more hurt to Rachel while Chloe tries to convince her to meet Rachel .
After the conversation , Sera lets Chloe choose whether she should tell Rachel the truth or not .
Chloe can also give Sera Rachel 's bracelet if she has it , but she will give it back if Chloe did n't convince her .
After Sera leaves , Chloe returns to the hospital and has to decide whether to lie to Rachel ( which will cause her to make amends with James ) or tell her everything ( which will cause her to disown her father and sever ties with him for his wrongdoings ) .
Regardless of her choice , she and Rachel remain friends at the end .
The following scenes are then shown ( which will all vary depending on Chloe 's choices ): 1 .
The Amber family either happily spending time with each other or in disarray .
2 .
Frank sitting by his RV holding a box of Damon 's things .
3 .
Nathan and Samantha either spending time with each other or drifting apart ( if Chloe was n't supportive of them ) .
4 .
Chloe either embracing Joyce and David or still maintaining personal issues towards David .
5 .
Eliot , whose actions at the Amber house had led to him being expelled , preparing to leave Blackwell and will tear up a photograph of him and Chloe if she lost the backtalk . 6 .
Steph , Drew , and Mikey playing a tabletop game in front of Blackwell with one of the brothers still recovering from his injuries .
The remaining scenes show Chloe and Rachel spending time together .
While sitting near the lighthouse , Sera will show up if she was convinced by Chloe to meet Rachel .
At the very end of the episode , in the final cinematic , the fate of Rachel Amber is suggested to be similar to that of Victoria and Max 's from the first game , where Rachel 's phone can be seen ringing inside the underground vault with Chloe being on the other line and the click of a camera can be heard in the background , implying that Rachel is photographed by either Nathan or Jefferson ."

[EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Rachel looks awesome...","The episode starts with a hooded Chloe Price smoking a cigarette and standing at the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to come. After its passage, she takes off her hood and goes towards the old mill, ignoring the ""No Trespassing"" sign after jumping over a fence. In order to get inside the mill, she starts an argument with the bouncer, in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails. After entering, she can interact with people, objects, graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money (or not). If she steals the money, she'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later. After this, she'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys, the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her. However, she'll manage to see the band by going upstairs, even with the floor there being rotten. She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her. She's saved by Rachel Amber, in her very first appearance, and will have the first major choice of the game: attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing. After running downstairs, the two girls stop and look at Frank, who notices what's going to happen and quickly stops the guys, causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill. Rachel pulls Chloe along with her, and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night. The next morning, Chloe is shown waking up in her room, at the Price household. She sits up and takes her red 'Oregon' ashtray and starts smoking a cigarette (or weed, if she bought it from Frank earlier with the stolen money). Chloe can look at a photo of her and Max Caulfield as kids along with her dad, William Price and can also look at her diary. After being called by her mother, Joyce Price, for breakfast downstairs, she'll get up from her bed and will be able to interact with many objects around her room. She'll change clothes before leaving her room (the player gets to choose her outfit). Due to having drunk too much, Chloe notices her phone is missing. She then goes to her mother's room to call her phone with her mother's phone. There, she can interact with another object before using her mother's phone. By doing this, Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom, and just after she takes it, her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone, causing her to go back to the room. When she finally goes downstairs, she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on. She'll then talk with her mother about several topics, and at the end of the conversation, she'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels. Depending on her choice, Joyce will be either kind or tough towards her. Chloe'll have to pick the keys from her stepfather, David Madsen, and take them to him since he'll be taking her to school today. After leaving the house and going to David, he'll ask her to get the tools he needs to fix his car in the garage. After this, she gets in the car and David will try to start a conversation with her. She can either start a fight with him or listen to what he has to say. After the talk, Chloe will fall asleep and have a weird dream about being in a car with her dad, going to pick up her mom from the grocery store. The dream abruptly ends with a truck crashing through William's car. When she wakes up, she's already at Blackwell Academy. There, she can talk to Eliot Hampden (and choose whether or not she wants to watch The Tempest play with him), Victoria Chase (with the option of sabotaging her homework if doing so), Skip Matthews (with the option of listening to the demo of his band, PissHead, and giving him your opinion on it if doing so), Principal Wells (only if she sits on a crate on the stage and with the option of starting a backtalk challenge with him if doing so), Michelle Grant, Mikey North and Steph Gingrich (in order to get her DVD and with the additional option of playing a tabletop game with them), and other students. Afterwards, she'll go towards the school entrance, but she'll be interrupted by Drew North and Nathan Prescott, who are starting a fight. A student called Samantha Myers urges Chloe to do something to help Nathan, and Chloe can either backtalk Drew and defend Nathan or just ignore them, which will cause Samantha to either thank Chloe or be upset with her for not helping. When the fight is over, she can finally enter the school, and just as she opens the door, Rachel appears on the other side and pulls her along with her to the Drama Lab where Travis Keaton is rehearsing with Dana Ward and Hayden Jones. Rachel will ask for her opinion on Miranda's love for Fernando, both portrayed by Dana and Hayden respectively in ""The Tempest"" play, and Chloe can choose whether to say it's true love or not. After the class is over, everyone will leave the room, except for Chloe and Rachel. Rachel will change to normal clothes and ask Chloe to get her belt from her bag and bring it to her. After doing this, they'll have a short conversation before Rachel invites Chloe to skip school, and they end up in a train carriage where, after finding some crates to sit on, they play the game Two Truths and a Lie. Chloe can either cheat or follow the game rules. After their game, Chloe will have the option of sharing or not her earbuds with Rachel during their trip. Upon arriving at Overlook Park, they'll play another game using the viewfinders to spy on people around the park. However, the viewfinder that they intend to use it broken. Chloe asks Rachel for something sharp like a knife and she gives her a nail file, which Chloe uses to unscrew a deducation plate from a park bench and then uses it to break open the viewfinder, allowing them to use it for free. When they get a closer view of the last couple available, a man and a woman under a tree, Rachel gets distressed when they start kissing and puts an end to their game, telling Chloe she needs to get drunk. They'll then go to the other side of the park, where a couple is having a picnic and have a bottle of wine on their table. Rachel approaches the couple and starts acting sick, throwing herself to the ground and pretending to be in need of resuscitation. Chloe can encourage the man to help her, either succeeding or failing on doing so resulting in the man ""saving"" Rachel's life or the woman seeing through their ploy. Whatever the outcome is, the two girls will get the wine. After this, they're shown walking on the train tracks. Chloe invites Rachel to explore a junkyard nearby and Rachel lets her explore on her own. After a long conversation between the two, no matter what choices the player has made so far, Rachel will leave, but not before Chloe tries to convince her to stay. Chloe has the option to say that they have a real friendship or something more. Once Rachel leaves, Chloe gets angry and breaks everything around her. She then has a meltdown upon seeing her late father's car. She'll fall asleep and have another dream about her father, this time, with him advising/warning her on her relationship with Rachel, in which Chloe will see Rachel outside of the car, who will then catch fire. When she wakes up, it's already night and she goes back to the overlook where she finds Rachel. Upon a brief dialogue, in which Rachel reveals the man they had seen at the park was her dad, and that he was cheating on her mother with that woman. Rachel takes out a photo of her as a kid with her father, asks Chloe for her lighter which she uses it burn the photo, throwing it into a nearby trash bin, and starting a wildfire by kicking the bin into a tree nearby.

Rachel will ask for her opinion on Miranda's love for Fernando, both portrayed by Dana and Hayden respectively in ""The Tempest"" play, and Chloe can choose whether to say it's true love or not. After the class is over, everyone will leave the room, except for Chloe and Rachel. Rachel will change to normal clothes and ask Chloe to get her belt from her bag and bring it to her. After doing this, they'll have a short conversation before Rachel invites Chloe to skip school, and they end up in a train carriage where, after finding some crates to sit on, they play the game Two Truths and a Lie. Chloe can either cheat or follow the game rules. After their game, Chloe will have the option of sharing or not her earbuds with Rachel during their trip. Upon arriving at Overlook Park, they'll play another game using the viewfinders to spy on people around the park. However, the viewfinder that they intend to use it broken. Chloe asks Rachel for something sharp like a knife and she gives her a nail file, which Chloe uses to unscrew a deducation plate from a park bench and then uses it to break open the viewfinder, allowing them to use it for free. When they get a closer view of the last couple available, a man and a woman under a tree, Rachel gets distressed when they start kissing and puts an end to their game, telling Chloe she needs to get drunk. They'll then go to the other side of the park, where a couple is having a picnic and have a bottle of wine on their table. Rachel approaches the couple and starts acting sick, throwing herself to the ground and pretending to be in need of resuscitation. Chloe can encourage the man to help her, either succeeding or failing on doing so resulting in the man ""saving"" Rachel's life or the woman seeing through their ploy. Whatever the outcome is, the two girls will get the wine. After this, they're shown walking on the train tracks. Chloe invites Rachel to explore a junkyard nearby and Rachel lets her explore on her own.

Chloe has the option to say that they have a real friendship or something more. Once Rachel leaves, Chloe gets angry and breaks everything around her.

Rachel takes out a photo of her as a kid with her father, asks Chloe for her lighter which she uses it burn the photo, throwing it into a nearby trash bin, and starting a wildfire by kicking the bin into a tree nearby. Rachel then screams, increasing the fire's intensity. The episode ends showing each character's reaction to the wildfire seen in the sky.

23,23,0.25,0.29577,23,23,"Then the viewfinder and the blackness disappear and Chloe and Rachel are again sitting on the couch across from James and Rose.
[EX]   JAMES : Chloe, I believe Rachel trusts you more than anyone else right now.
[EX]   S0 : CHOICE: (Said Chloe gave Joyce money)  [EX]   FRANK : And don't try any ""I gave it to my mom"" bullshit.","Continuing from the last episode where Chloe Price is at Rachel Amber's house for dinner when Rachel accuses her father of cheating, James Amber reveals that the woman he was with in the park was Rachel's real mother, Sera Gearhardt. He then tells them the whole story, in which Chloe and Rachel then find themselves in a dark area with a viewfinder. As James tells the story, they look through the viewfinder, which shows them visuals of how Sera and James met in high school and fell in love. They had a child together (Rachel) but Sera became a drug addict. Growing fearful of Sera's behavior, James eventually left with the child and made an agreement with Sera to pay her monthly if she agreed to stay away. This worked for 15 years. Rachel is devastated and wants to meet Sera, but has no idea how to find her before heading upstairs. Chloe agrees to help (against James's wishes) and goes to Rachel's room, where she finds Rachel laying in bed and is still upset with her father's lies. After using a flashlight from a toolbox and a star globe from a night light to form a starry night, Chloe is able to talk to Rachel, promising to help find Sera. Chloe then has another dream where she is onstage in her Ariel costume on some seats that are arranged to look like car seats. William is sitting in the front row of seats, acting like he is driving. He explains the reason why people keep secrets: to keep their loved ones safe. The dream ends with an actual truck appearing onstage and crushing William, causing Chloe to fall in depression while Victoria can be heard booing her. The next morning, she returns home (in which she may discover that David had searched through her room depending on decisions made in the previous episodes) and calls Frank Bowers, who reluctantly agrees to meet Chloe at the junkyard. While heading downstairs, she sees Joyce and David embracing each other. When she tries to sneak pass them, they see her. David reveals that he has decided to trust Chloe more if she stops taking drugs but despite this, Chloe still refuses to change. David then explains the reason while he's here: his friend Phil Becker had died during their last mission in the army, and he did not want Chloe to suffer the same pain that he had when he lost his friend and hands her a photo of him and Phil. Chloe can choose whether to take the picture or reject it, which will earn David's trust or anger. She then leaves for the junkyard taking her father's toolbox and an old repair manual with her. At the junkyard, Chloe fixes the old truck (requiring repairs on four parts of the engine) and uses a spark plug from the car that was formerly owned by William to finish the repairs. After taking the truck for a test drive, she continues to wait for Frank. Rachel shows up, as does Frank - but he isn't alone. Damon Merrick is here too and demands to know why Chloe is trying to find Sera. Through a conversation, Damon reveals that he knows Sera's whereabouts and learns that Rachel is James Amber's daughter. An altercation takes place (in which Chloe can give Damon the money she took from Drew and Mikey's room if she kept it) and Rachel attacks Damon with a wooden board and is then stabbed in the arm, shocking Chloe and Frank. Frank then hold back Damon while Chloe rushes Rachel to the hospital. Once there, two nurses quickly take her to surgery while Chloe stays in the waiting room. James and Amber later show up and when James asks Chloe what happened, she tearfully tells James the whole story. Chloe can then use this time to talk to Rose, Anthony North (Drew and Mikey's father), the couple from Episode 1, Steph, Drew, and Mikey (with the option of playing one last tabletop game with them). Rachel survives but still wants to find her mother. After James leaves them to talk, she convinces Chloe to break into her dad's office and gives her a code to disarm the alarm. Before leaving, she briefly speaks to Eliot Hampden. She can also eavesdrop on a conversation (or argument) that Samantha's mother is having with either Nathan or Sean in one of the rooms regarding Samantha's injury (presumed to be Nathan's doing). While at James's office, she finds a key hidden in a trophy and uses it to unlock a drawer, which contains evidence showing that James lied about a lot of things and that Damon has Sera. She contacts Damon using James's phone (who, in return, thinks she is James) and has her do some favors: destroy the evidence (which is a glove that Chloe must burn using her lighter and a trash can), finding the snitch (which has to be anyone other than Frank) and showing him the money he promised to give him (which is hidden behind some books on the bookshelf). After all this, he then reveals that Sera is held captive at the old mill. Before she can leave, she is caught by Eliot (who had followed Chloe from the hospital) and closes the door from behind, reactivating the alarm. An argument between the two begins, in which Eliot reveals that he strongly dislikes Rachel and wants Chloe all to himself, while Chloe backtalks against him while trying to call the police by pretending to agree with Eliot. If she wins the backtalk, the police will arrive and Chloe leaves while Eliot stays behind to confront the police. If she loses, Eliot will find out what she's up to, which will make Chloe set off the alarm, forcing Eliot to leave. After escaping, she drives to the old mill. After avoiding a logger truck, she stops near the burnt forest and will speak to an illusion of William, who convinces Chloe to keep going. After arriving at the old mill, she finds Frank's RV and heads into the mill. Optionally, she can find a knife in the mill to use as a weapon against Damon. Chloe confronts Damon, who has Sera tied up in a chair. He reveals that James is paying him to kill Sera and when Chloe tries to stop him, she gets knocked to the ground and is knocked unconscious by him. An injured Frank enters and struggles with Damon, presumably killing him afterwards as Frank got the better of him. Chloe wakes up and talks with Sera, who tries to convince her to not tell Rachel about anything that happened at the mill or her father's corruptive actions (while also believing that she can never be a good mother to Rachel and wishes for her to be with a father who loves her), knowing that it will cause more hurt to Rachel while Chloe tries to convince her to meet Rachel. After the conversation, Sera lets Chloe choose whether she should tell Rachel the truth or not. Chloe can also give Sera Rachel's bracelet if she has it, but she will give it back if Chloe didn't convince her. After Sera leaves, Chloe returns to the hospital and has to decide whether to lie to Rachel (which will cause her to make amends with James) or tell her everything (which will cause her to disown her father and sever ties with him for his wrongdoings). Regardless of her choice, she and Rachel remain friends at the end. The following scenes are then shown (which will all vary depending on Chloe's choices): 1. The Amber family either happily spending time with each other or in disarray. 2. Frank sitting by his RV holding a box of Damon's things. 3. Nathan and Samantha either spending time with each other or drifting apart (if Chloe wasn't supportive of them). 4. Chloe either embracing Joyce and David or still maintaining personal issues towards David. 5. Eliot, whose actions at the Amber house had led to him being expelled, preparing to leave Blackwell and will tear up a photograph of him and Chloe if she lost the backtalk. 6. Steph, Drew, and Mikey playing a tabletop game in front of Blackwell with one of the brothers still recovering from his injuries. The remaining scenes show Chloe and Rachel spending time together. While sitting near the lighthouse, Sera will show up if she was convinced by Chloe to meet Rachel. At the very end of the episode, in the final cinematic, the fate of Rachel Amber is suggested to be similar to that of Victoria and Max's from the first game, where Rachel's phone can be seen ringing inside the underground vault with Chloe being on the other line and the click of a camera can be heard in the background, implying that Rachel is photographed by either Nathan or Jefferson.

","David , Joyce , Wells , Victoria , James , Rose , and the raven are sitting in the audience , most of them with their arms crossed .

To unlock the "" Leave it be "" option , Chloe must walk away , then try to steal the pudding again , and Drew takes it out of her hands .","Continuing from the last episode where Chloe Price is at Rachel Amber 's house for dinner when Rachel accuses her father of cheating , James Amber reveals that the woman he was with in the park was Rachel 's real mother , Sera Gearhardt .
He then tells them the whole story , in which Chloe and Rachel then find themselves in a dark area with a viewfinder .
As James tells the story , they look through the viewfinder , which shows them visuals of how Sera and James met in high school and fell in love .
They had a child together ( Rachel ) but Sera became a drug addict .
Growing fearful of Sera 's behavior , James eventually left with the child and made an agreement with Sera to pay her monthly if she agreed to stay away .
This worked for 15 years .
Rachel is devastated and wants to meet Sera , but has no idea how to find her before heading upstairs .
Chloe agrees to help ( against James 's wishes ) and goes to Rachel 's room , where she finds Rachel laying in bed and is still upset with her father 's lies .
After using a flashlight from a toolbox and a star globe from a night light to form a starry night , Chloe is able to talk to Rachel , promising to help find Sera .
Chloe then has another dream where she is onstage in her Ariel costume on some seats that are arranged to look like car seats .
William is sitting in the front row of seats , acting like he is driving .
He explains the reason why people keep secrets : to keep their loved ones safe .
The dream ends with an actual truck appearing onstage and crushing William , causing Chloe to fall in depression while Victoria can be heard booing her .
The next morning , she returns home ( in which she may discover that David had searched through her room depending on decisions made in the previous episodes ) and calls Frank Bowers , who reluctantly agrees to meet Chloe at the junkyard .
While heading downstairs , she sees Joyce and David embracing each other .
When she tries to sneak pass them , they see her .
David reveals that he has decided to trust Chloe more if she stops taking drugs but despite this , Chloe still refuses to change .
David then explains the reason while he 's here : his friend Phil Becker had died during their last mission in the army , and he did not want Chloe to suffer the same pain that he had when he lost his friend and hands her a photo of him and Phil .
Chloe can choose whether to take the picture or reject it , which will earn David 's trust or anger .
She then leaves for the junkyard taking her father 's toolbox and an old repair manual with her .
At the junkyard , Chloe fixes the old truck ( requiring repairs on four parts of the engine ) and uses a spark plug from the car that was formerly owned by William to finish the repairs .
After taking the truck for a test drive , she continues to wait for Frank .
Rachel shows up , as does Frank - but he is n't alone .
Damon Merrick is here too and demands to know why Chloe is trying to find Sera .
Through a conversation , Damon reveals that he knows Sera 's whereabouts and learns that Rachel is James Amber 's daughter .
An altercation takes place ( in which Chloe can give Damon the money she took from Drew and Mikey 's room if she kept it ) and Rachel attacks Damon with a wooden board and is then stabbed in the arm , shocking Chloe and Frank .
Frank then hold back Damon while Chloe rushes Rachel to the hospital .
Once there , two nurses quickly take her to surgery while Chloe stays in the waiting room .
James and Amber later show up and when James asks Chloe what happened , she tearfully tells James the whole story .
Chloe can then use this time to talk to Rose , Anthony North ( Drew and Mikey 's father ) , the couple from Episode 1 , Steph , Drew , and Mikey ( with the option of playing one last tabletop game with them ) .
Rachel survives but still wants to find her mother .
After James leaves them to talk , she convinces Chloe to break into her dad 's office and gives her a code to disarm the alarm .
Before leaving , she briefly speaks to Eliot Hampden .
She can also eavesdrop on a conversation ( or argument ) that Samantha 's mother is having with either Nathan or Sean in one of the rooms regarding Samantha 's injury ( presumed to be Nathan 's doing ) .
While at James 's office , she finds a key hidden in a trophy and uses it to unlock a drawer , which contains evidence showing that James lied about a lot of things and that Damon has Sera .
She contacts Damon using James 's phone ( who , in return , thinks she is James ) and has her do some favors : destroy the evidence ( which is a glove that Chloe must burn using her lighter and a trash can ) , finding the snitch ( which has to be anyone other than Frank ) and showing him the money he promised to give him ( which is hidden behind some books on the bookshelf ) .
After all this , he then reveals that Sera is held captive at the old mill .
Before she can leave , she is caught by Eliot ( who had followed Chloe from the hospital ) and closes the door from behind , reactivating the alarm .
An argument between the two begins , in which Eliot reveals that he strongly dislikes Rachel and wants Chloe all to himself , while Chloe backtalks against him while trying to call the police by pretending to agree with Eliot .
If she wins the backtalk , the police will arrive and Chloe leaves while Eliot stays behind to confront the police .
If she loses , Eliot will find out what she 's up to , which will make Chloe set off the alarm , forcing Eliot to leave .
After escaping , she drives to the old mill .
After avoiding a logger truck , she stops near the burnt forest and will speak to an illusion of William , who convinces Chloe to keep going .
After arriving at the old mill , she finds Frank 's RV and heads into the mill .
Optionally , she can find a knife in the mill to use as a weapon against Damon .
Chloe confronts Damon , who has Sera tied up in a chair .
He reveals that James is paying him to kill Sera and when Chloe tries to stop him , she gets knocked to the ground and is knocked unconscious by him .
An injured Frank enters and struggles with Damon , presumably killing him afterwards as Frank got the better of him .

Both Rachel and Chloe are questioned about their absence the day before. The conversation varies depending on how Chloe treated Joyce, if she sabotaged Victoria's homework, if she went onstage and smoked weed, whether she helped Nathan or not, and if she won or lost the backtalk against Drew (if she helped Nathan). Rachel claims their misbehavior was her idea, and as punishment, is removed as Wells' administrative assistant and her role as Prospera in The Tempest. If Chloe goes along with Rachel, she will be suspended. If Chloe takes the blame for Rachel, she will be expelled, but Rachel won't be removed from the play. After they leave the office, Skip Matthews escorts Chloe to her locker, so she can clean it out. Chloe searches for her hidden joint but discovers Justin Williams has taken it. Angry, Chloe lies to Skip that she has to use the bathroom. Meanwhile, Joyce speaks with Rachel's parents, James, and Rose Amber. Once inside, she proceeds to tag it from ceiling to floor, venting her frustration. She then exits and Victoria approaches the bathroom, looking dumbfounded as she opens the door. Chloe enters the parking lot of Blackwell Academy. She can optionally talk to Eliot, who will feel sympathy for her expulsion or suspension and offer her a hug. He will again ask her if she wants to go to the play with him. Chloe walks to the car where Joyce and David are waiting for her; David asks her to empty her pockets on the hood of the car. David later announces that he will be moving in with them. This outrages Chloe and she storms off. David stops Joyce from going after her, wanting to give her some time to get over her anger. Chloe goes to the junkyard and knocks over items with her bat until she notices a very old truck. She scours the junkyard for various items needed to fix the truck: a battery from an impounded truck (which requires having to press a button to unlock the hood); something to cover the hole in the floor: a rug, a welcome mat, or a golf mat; a new light bulb from either a fish tank, a toy robot, or a Christmas wreath; and something to cover the torn seat: a pirate flag or a beach towel. She can also optionally decorate the truck using an Elvis Presley bobblehead found in a small box somewhere in the junkyard and draw a decoration on the back of the seat. Despite all her hard work, the truck still remains inoperational. She then relaxes in the driver's seat and smokes a cigarette. Chloe finds herself in another one of her dreams. She finds William, her deceased father, roasting marshmallows in the burning wreckage of his car. She sits next to him and roasts marshmallows too, as he warns her about the danger of fire, a metaphor for Rachel Amber. The dream ends with William's face being shown half-burnt with a raven pecking at his face. Chloe wakes up to find Rachel tapping on the window of her car, carrying a duffel bag. Rachel gets inside the car and the two have a ""therapy session"" (which will vary depending on if Rachel was removed from the play or not): they discuss their feelings about the current events in their life and how unhappy they are with them. Rachel leaves and gives Chloe her duffel bag, which is full of clothes. Chloe receives a call from Frank Bowers, who wants to meet up with her. Chloe enters the Hideout in the junkyard. She can optionally spruce up the place and then changes into one of Rachel's outfits. Frank approaches in his RV. Chloe sees a woman leaving the vehicle. She enters Frank's RV and he drives away. He asks her to retrieve his account book. Chloe opens the door to his bedroom, and Pompidou runs out. She takes his account book and brings it to him. Chloe then asks Frank about the woman, but he refuses to say anything. Frank reveals that Drew North runs Oxy for Damon Merrick and he owes him $1,000. He asks her to go to the school to find the money and bring it to him. After Frank drops off Chloe, she can speak with Steph Gingrich, Evan Harris, and Samuel Taylor. She shoos away a bird that Evan is photographing to distract him long enough for Chloe to damage a nearby sprinkler. This gets Samuel's attention and while he goes to fix the sprinkler, Chloe takes his keys and uses it to unlock the dorm, but encounters Skip. An argument begins, which will earn either Skip's trust or anger before he leaves to deal with an unauthorized vehicle in the parking lot (presumably Frank's RV). After she enters Drew and Mikey's room, she must figure out the combination to a locked trunk containing the money. If she fails too many times, she will get help from Steph. After getting the money, she is caught by Mikey and Drew (who are preparing to leave), followed by the arrival of Damon. Drew goes out to talk to him while telling Chloe not to leave the room. Upon hearing Damon beat up Drew, Chloe must choose whether to intervene or stay in the room, which will lead Drew to be glad for staying out of the way or upset for interfering. If she stays out of the fight, Drew will get injured and after Damon leaves, Chloe must choose to give the money to Drew or keep it. If she intervenes, Mikey will get hurt instead and Chloe will hand the money over to Damon, who then leaves. It is now late afternoon and Blackwell begins to start the play. Chloe can find Samantha Myers overhearing Nathan Prescott talking with his father, who wants his son to get over his fear and not humiliate him. Chloe can choose whether to talk to him or keep quiet. She can then convince Samantha to cheer for Nathan and can also encourage Nathan, be sarcastic towards him, or do nothing. Afterwards, she can talk to Hayden Jones, Dana Ward, and Travis Keaton and has the option of playing with the spotlights. In the changing room, Chloe will face a situation between Rachel and Victoria which varies depending on if Rachel was dropped from the play or not. If Rachel was removed from the play, this will lead to either Chloe getting Victoria to drop from the play via backtalk or Rachel drugging Victoria's tea if Chloe was nice to Victoria or lost the backtalk. If Rachel wasn't removed, Victoria will drug Rachel's tea instead. Chloe can either warn Rachel or distract Victoria. If she warns Rachel, she will get Victoria to drink the drugged tea by pretending to believe her. If Chloe distracts Victoria, she will temporally leave and Chloe will switch the cups, leading Victoria to drink the drugged tea upon returning. Keaton later informs the students that Juliet Watson, who was meant to play as Ariel, is delayed by the wildfire that Rachel caused and can't make it in time. Following this, Victoria will then either drop from the play (in which Rachel will then volunteer to take over for Victoria) or fall unconscious. Rachel then convinces a reluctant Chloe to take over for Juliet. As Chloe and Rachel perform onstage as Prospera and Ariel, Nathan then comes in, who will either leave in embarrassment or have confidence and play out his role. Juliet later arrives and replaces Chloe's spot in the play. At the end of the play, Rachel, Hayden, Dana, Juliet, Keaton, and Nathan all come out and bow to the audience, with Rachel bringing Chloe out to join the other performers. The mysterious woman from earlier is seen watching them from a distance. Rachel and Chloe are next seen wandering down a street together. Rachel is happy about the play and how Chloe took part in it. The two then discuss their plan to leave Arcadia Bay, in which Chloe can either receive Rachel's bracelet, a promise for a tattoo, or a kiss. After the conversation, they then head to Rachel's house to pick up clothes. Rachel and Chloe attempt to sneak upstairs but are caught by James. When James compliments her performance, her mood changes, and she despondently replies ""thanks"". Rachel heads upstairs to freshen up, leaving Chloe with her parents. Chloe then helps Rose set up plates and cups for the dinner table, question James of what he wants to drink (in which he will ask for Sherry), and light the candles on the table with her lighter. The four all sit down for dinner and Rachel's parents begin talking about the forest fire and the reports that it was arson. The conversation soon turns into an argument when Rachel's anger visibly increases throughout James's lecture. Chloe can either calm Rachel down or attack James on his misdeeds with her backtalk. Whichever option is chosen, Rachel will lose her temper and call James out. When Chloe and Rose join in the argument, Rachel begins to dissociate and eventually throws a salad bowl through the table, smashing it. She screams at James to tell her the truth. James tells her that the woman he kissed was not his mistress, but is in fact, Rachel's biological mother. The episode ends with scenes showing Steph at the hospital to see Drew and Mikey, Joyce embracing David in despair upon seeing that Chloe hasn't returned, Rachel's biological mother smoking a cigarette, Damon approaching Frank (how they will react depends on whether Chloe gave the money to Damon, Drew, or kept it), Victoria looking at a Tempest poster the dressing room before stepping on it and leaving, Samantha approaching Nathan, and the wildfire still happening in the distance.

[EX]   S0 : CHOICE: (Saw the photo Rachel posted)  [EX]   CHLOE : People can eat a dick.
[EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Rachel looks awesome...","The episode starts with a hooded Chloe Price smoking a cigarette and standing at the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to come. After its passage, she takes off her hood and goes towards the old mill, ignoring the ""No Trespassing"" sign after jumping over a fence. In order to get inside the mill, she starts an argument with the bouncer, in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails. After entering, she can interact with people, objects, graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money (or not). If she steals the money, she'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later. After this, she'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys, the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her. However, she'll manage to see the band by going upstairs, even with the floor there being rotten. She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her. She's saved by Rachel Amber, in her very first appearance, and will have the first major choice of the game: attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing. After running downstairs, the two girls stop and look at Frank, who notices what's going to happen and quickly stops the guys, causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill. Rachel pulls Chloe along with her, and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night. The next morning, Chloe is shown waking up in her room, at the Price household. She sits up and takes her red 'Oregon' ashtray and starts smoking a cigarette (or weed, if she bought it from Frank earlier with the stolen money). Chloe can look at a photo of her and Max Caulfield as kids along with her dad, William Price and can also look at her diary. After being called by her mother, Joyce Price, for breakfast downstairs, she'll get up from her bed and will be able to interact with many objects around her room. She'll change clothes before leaving her room (the player gets to choose her outfit). Due to having drunk too much, Chloe notices her phone is missing. She then goes to her mother's room to call her phone with her mother's phone. There, she can interact with another object before using her mother's phone. By doing this, Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom, and just after she takes it, her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone, causing her to go back to the room. When she finally goes downstairs, she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on. She'll then talk with her mother about several topics, and at the end of the conversation, she'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels. Depending on her choice, Joyce will be either kind or tough towards her. Chloe'll have to pick the keys from her stepfather, David Madsen, and take them to him since he'll be taking her to school today. After leaving the house and going to David, he'll ask her to get the tools he needs to fix his car in the garage. After this, she gets in the car and David will try to start a conversation with her. She can either start a fight with him or listen to what he has to say. After the talk, Chloe will fall asleep and have a weird dream about being in a car with her dad, going to pick up her mom from the grocery store. The dream abruptly ends with a truck crashing through William's car. When she wakes up, she's already at Blackwell Academy. There, she can talk to Eliot Hampden (and choose whether or not she wants to watch The Tempest play with him), Victoria Chase (with the option of sabotaging her homework if doing so), Skip Matthews (with the option of listening to the demo of his band, PissHead, and giving him your opinion on it if doing so), Principal Wells (only if she sits on a crate on the stage and with the option of starting a backtalk challenge with him if doing so), Michelle Grant, Mikey North and Steph Gingrich (in order to get her DVD and with the additional option of playing a tabletop game with them), and other students. Afterwards, she'll go towards the school entrance, but she'll be interrupted by Drew North and Nathan Prescott, who are starting a fight. A student called Samantha Myers urges Chloe to do something to help Nathan, and Chloe can either backtalk Drew and defend Nathan or just ignore them, which will cause Samantha to either thank Chloe or be upset with her for not helping. When the fight is over, she can finally enter the school, and just as she opens the door, Rachel appears on the other side and pulls her along with her to the Drama Lab where Travis Keaton is rehearsing with Dana Ward and Hayden Jones. Rachel will ask for her opinion on Miranda's love for Fernando, both portrayed by Dana and Hayden respectively in ""The Tempest"" play, and Chloe can choose whether to say it's true love or not. After the class is over, everyone will leave the room, except for Chloe and Rachel. Rachel will change to normal clothes and ask Chloe to get her belt from her bag and bring it to her. After doing this, they'll have a short conversation before Rachel invites Chloe to skip school, and they end up in a train carriage where, after finding some crates to sit on, they play the game Two Truths and a Lie. Chloe can either cheat or follow the game rules. After their game, Chloe will have the option of sharing or not her earbuds with Rachel during their trip. Upon arriving at Overlook Park, they'll play another game using the viewfinders to spy on people around the park. However, the viewfinder that they intend to use it broken. Chloe asks Rachel for something sharp like a knife and she gives her a nail file, which Chloe uses to unscrew a deducation plate from a park bench and then uses it to break open the viewfinder, allowing them to use it for free. When they get a closer view of the last couple available, a man and a woman under a tree, Rachel gets distressed when they start kissing and puts an end to their game, telling Chloe she needs to get drunk. They'll then go to the other side of the park, where a couple is having a picnic and have a bottle of wine on their table. Rachel approaches the couple and starts acting sick, throwing herself to the ground and pretending to be in need of resuscitation. Chloe can encourage the man to help her, either succeeding or failing on doing so resulting in the man ""saving"" Rachel's life or the woman seeing through their ploy. Whatever the outcome is, the two girls will get the wine. After this, they're shown walking on the train tracks. Chloe invites Rachel to explore a junkyard nearby and Rachel lets her explore on her own. After a long conversation between the two, no matter what choices the player has made so far, Rachel will leave, but not before Chloe tries to convince her to stay. Chloe has the option to say that they have a real friendship or something more. Once Rachel leaves, Chloe gets angry and breaks everything around her. She then has a meltdown upon seeing her late father's car. She'll fall asleep and have another dream about her father, this time, with him advising/warning her on her relationship with Rachel, in which Chloe will see Rachel outside of the car, who will then catch fire. When she wakes up, it's already night and she goes back to the overlook where she finds Rachel. Upon a brief dialogue, in which Rachel reveals the man they had seen at the park was her dad, and that he was cheating on her mother with that woman. Rachel takes out a photo of her as a kid with her father, asks Chloe for her lighter which she uses it burn the photo, throwing it into a nearby trash bin, and starting a wildfire by kicking the bin into a tree nearby.

[EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Rachel would want to know more.","Episode 2: Brave New World begins with Rachel Amber and Chloe Price in Principal Wells' office. Both Rachel and Chloe are questioned about their absence the day before. The conversation varies depending on how Chloe treated Joyce, if she sabotaged Victoria's homework, if she went onstage and smoked weed, whether she helped Nathan or not, and if she won or lost the backtalk against Drew (if she helped Nathan). Rachel claims their misbehavior was her idea, and as punishment, is removed as Wells' administrative assistant and her role as Prospera in The Tempest. If Chloe goes along with Rachel, she will be suspended. If Chloe takes the blame for Rachel, she will be expelled, but Rachel won't be removed from the play. After they leave the office, Skip Matthews escorts Chloe to her locker, so she can clean it out. Chloe searches for her hidden joint but discovers Justin Williams has taken it. Angry, Chloe lies to Skip that she has to use the bathroom. Meanwhile, Joyce speaks with Rachel's parents, James, and Rose Amber. Once inside, she proceeds to tag it from ceiling to floor, venting her frustration. She then exits and Victoria approaches the bathroom, looking dumbfounded as she opens the door. Chloe enters the parking lot of Blackwell Academy. She can optionally talk to Eliot, who will feel sympathy for her expulsion or suspension and offer her a hug. He will again ask her if she wants to go to the play with him. Chloe walks to the car where Joyce and David are waiting for her; David asks her to empty her pockets on the hood of the car. David later announces that he will be moving in with them. This outrages Chloe and she storms off. David stops Joyce from going after her, wanting to give her some time to get over her anger. Chloe goes to the junkyard and knocks over items with her bat until she notices a very old truck. She scours the junkyard for various items needed to fix the truck: a battery from an impounded truck (which requires having to press a button to unlock the hood); something to cover the hole in the floor: a rug, a welcome mat, or a golf mat; a new light bulb from either a fish tank, a toy robot, or a Christmas wreath; and something to cover the torn seat: a pirate flag or a beach towel. She can also optionally decorate the truck using an Elvis Presley bobblehead found in a small box somewhere in the junkyard and draw a decoration on the back of the seat. Despite all her hard work, the truck still remains inoperational. She then relaxes in the driver's seat and smokes a cigarette. Chloe finds herself in another one of her dreams. She finds William, her deceased father, roasting marshmallows in the burning wreckage of his car. She sits next to him and roasts marshmallows too, as he warns her about the danger of fire, a metaphor for Rachel Amber. The dream ends with William's face being shown half-burnt with a raven pecking at his face. Chloe wakes up to find Rachel tapping on the window of her car, carrying a duffel bag. Rachel gets inside the car and the two have a ""therapy session"" (which will vary depending on if Rachel was removed from the play or not): they discuss their feelings about the current events in their life and how unhappy they are with them. Rachel leaves and gives Chloe her duffel bag, which is full of clothes. Chloe receives a call from Frank Bowers, who wants to meet up with her. Chloe enters the Hideout in the junkyard. She can optionally spruce up the place and then changes into one of Rachel's outfits. Frank approaches in his RV. Chloe sees a woman leaving the vehicle. She enters Frank's RV and he drives away. He asks her to retrieve his account book. Chloe opens the door to his bedroom, and Pompidou runs out. She takes his account book and brings it to him. Chloe then asks Frank about the woman, but he refuses to say anything. Frank reveals that Drew North runs Oxy for Damon Merrick and he owes him $1,000. He asks her to go to the school to find the money and bring it to him. After Frank drops off Chloe, she can speak with Steph Gingrich, Evan Harris, and Samuel Taylor. She shoos away a bird that Evan is photographing to distract him long enough for Chloe to damage a nearby sprinkler. This gets Samuel's attention and while he goes to fix the sprinkler, Chloe takes his keys and uses it to unlock the dorm, but encounters Skip. An argument begins, which will earn either Skip's trust or anger before he leaves to deal with an unauthorized vehicle in the parking lot (presumably Frank's RV). After she enters Drew and Mikey's room, she must figure out the combination to a locked trunk containing the money. If she fails too many times, she will get help from Steph. After getting the money, she is caught by Mikey and Drew (who are preparing to leave), followed by the arrival of Damon. Drew goes out to talk to him while telling Chloe not to leave the room. Upon hearing Damon beat up Drew, Chloe must choose whether to intervene or stay in the room, which will lead Drew to be glad for staying out of the way or upset for interfering. If she stays out of the fight, Drew will get injured and after Damon leaves, Chloe must choose to give the money to Drew or keep it. If she intervenes, Mikey will get hurt instead and Chloe will hand the money over to Damon, who then leaves. It is now late afternoon and Blackwell begins to start the play. Chloe can find Samantha Myers overhearing Nathan Prescott talking with his father, who wants his son to get over his fear and not humiliate him. Chloe can choose whether to talk to him or keep quiet. She can then convince Samantha to cheer for Nathan and can also encourage Nathan, be sarcastic towards him, or do nothing. Afterwards, she can talk to Hayden Jones, Dana Ward, and Travis Keaton and has the option of playing with the spotlights. In the changing room, Chloe will face a situation between Rachel and Victoria which varies depending on if Rachel was dropped from the play or not. If Rachel was removed from the play, this will lead to either Chloe getting Victoria to drop from the play via backtalk or Rachel drugging Victoria's tea if Chloe was nice to Victoria or lost the backtalk. If Rachel wasn't removed, Victoria will drug Rachel's tea instead. Chloe can either warn Rachel or distract Victoria. If she warns Rachel, she will get Victoria to drink the drugged tea by pretending to believe her. If Chloe distracts Victoria, she will temporally leave and Chloe will switch the cups, leading Victoria to drink the drugged tea upon returning. Keaton later informs the students that Juliet Watson, who was meant to play as Ariel, is delayed by the wildfire that Rachel caused and can't make it in time. Following this, Victoria will then either drop from the play (in which Rachel will then volunteer to take over for Victoria) or fall unconscious. Rachel then convinces a reluctant Chloe to take over for Juliet. As Chloe and Rachel perform onstage as Prospera and Ariel, Nathan then comes in, who will either leave in embarrassment or have confidence and play out his role. Juliet later arrives and replaces Chloe's spot in the play. At the end of the play, Rachel, Hayden, Dana, Juliet, Keaton, and Nathan all come out and bow to the audience, with Rachel bringing Chloe out to join the other performers. The mysterious woman from earlier is seen watching them from a distance. Rachel and Chloe are next seen wandering down a street together. Rachel is happy about the play and how Chloe took part in it. The two then discuss their plan to leave Arcadia Bay, in which Chloe can either receive Rachel's bracelet, a promise for a tattoo, or a kiss. After the conversation, they then head to Rachel's house to pick up clothes. Rachel and Chloe attempt to sneak upstairs but are caught by James. When James compliments her performance, her mood changes, and she despondently replies ""thanks"". Rachel heads upstairs to freshen up, leaving Chloe with her parents. Chloe then helps Rose set up plates and cups for the dinner table, question James of what he wants to drink (in which he will ask for Sherry), and light the candles on the table with her lighter. The four all sit down for dinner and Rachel's parents begin talking about the forest fire and the reports that it was arson. The conversation soon turns into an argument when Rachel's anger visibly increases throughout James's lecture. Chloe can either calm Rachel down or attack James on his misdeeds with her backtalk. Whichever option is chosen, Rachel will lose her temper and call James out. When Chloe and Rose join in the argument, Rachel begins to dissociate and eventually throws a salad bowl through the table, smashing it. She screams at James to tell her the truth. James tells her that the woman he kissed was not his mistress, but is in fact, Rachel's biological mother. The episode ends with scenes showing Steph at the hospital to see Drew and Mikey, Joyce embracing David in despair upon seeing that Chloe hasn't returned, Rachel's biological mother smoking a cigarette, Damon approaching Frank (how they will react depends on whether Chloe gave the money to Damon, Drew, or kept it), Victoria looking at a Tempest poster the dressing room before stepping on it and leaving, Samantha approaching Nathan, and the wildfire still happening in the distance.

After its passage, she takes off her hood and goes towards the old mill, ignoring the ""No Trespassing"" sign after jumping over a fence. In order to get inside the mill, she starts an argument with the bouncer, in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails. After entering, she can interact with people, objects, graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money (or not). If she steals the money, she'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later. After this, she'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys, the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her. However, she'll manage to see the band by going upstairs, even with the floor there being rotten. She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her. She's saved by Rachel Amber, in her very first appearance, and will have the first major choice of the game: attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing. After running downstairs, the two girls stop and look at Frank, who notices what's going to happen and quickly stops the guys, causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill. Rachel pulls Chloe along with her, and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night. The next morning, Chloe is shown waking up in her room, at the Price household. She sits up and takes her red 'Oregon' ashtray and starts smoking a cigarette (or weed, if she bought it from Frank earlier with the stolen money). Chloe can look at a photo of her and Max Caulfield as kids along with her dad, William Price and can also look at her diary. After being called by her mother, Joyce Price, for breakfast downstairs, she'll get up from her bed and will be able to interact with many objects around her room. She'll change clothes before leaving her room (the player gets to choose her outfit). Due to having drunk too much, Chloe notices her phone is missing. She then goes to her mother's room to call her phone with her mother's phone. There, she can interact with another object before using her mother's phone. By doing this, Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom, and just after she takes it, her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone, causing her to go back to the room. When she finally goes downstairs, she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on. She'll then talk with her mother about several topics, and at the end of the conversation, she'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels. Depending on her choice, Joyce will be either kind or tough towards her. Chloe'll have to pick the keys from her stepfather, David Madsen, and take them to him since he'll be taking her to school today. After leaving the house and going to David, he'll ask her to get the tools he needs to fix his car in the garage. After this, she gets in the car and David will try to start a conversation with her. She can either start a fight with him or listen to what he has to say. After the talk, Chloe will fall asleep and have a weird dream about being in a car with her dad, going to pick up her mom from the grocery store. The dream abruptly ends with a truck crashing through William's car. When she wakes up, she's already at Blackwell Academy. There, she can talk to Eliot Hampden (and choose whether or not she wants to watch The Tempest play with him), Victoria Chase (with the option of sabotaging her homework if doing so), Skip Matthews (with the option of listening to the demo of his band, PissHead, and giving him your opinion on it if doing so), Principal Wells (only if she sits on a crate on the stage and with the option of starting a backtalk challenge with him if doing so), Michelle Grant, Mikey North and Steph Gingrich (in order to get her DVD and with the additional option of playing a tabletop game with them), and other students. Afterwards, she'll go towards the school entrance, but she'll be interrupted by Drew North and Nathan Prescott, who are starting a fight. A student called Samantha Myers urges Chloe to do something to help Nathan, and Chloe can either backtalk Drew and defend Nathan or just ignore them, which will cause Samantha to either thank Chloe or be upset with her for not helping. When the fight is over, she can finally enter the school, and just as she opens the door, Rachel appears on the other side and pulls her along with her to the Drama Lab where Travis Keaton is rehearsing with Dana Ward and Hayden Jones. Rachel will ask for her opinion on Miranda's love for Fernando, both portrayed by Dana and Hayden respectively in ""The Tempest"" play, and Chloe can choose whether to say it's true love or not. After the class is over, everyone will leave the room, except for Chloe and Rachel. Rachel will change to normal clothes and ask Chloe to get her belt from her bag and bring it to her. After doing this, they'll have a short conversation before Rachel invites Chloe to skip school, and they end up in a train carriage where, after finding some crates to sit on, they play the game Two Truths and a Lie. Chloe can either cheat or follow the game rules. After their game, Chloe will have the option of sharing or not her earbuds with Rachel during their trip. Upon arriving at Overlook Park, they'll play another game using the viewfinders to spy on people around the park. However, the viewfinder that they intend to use it broken. Chloe asks Rachel for something sharp like a knife and she gives her a nail file, which Chloe uses to unscrew a deducation plate from a park bench and then uses it to break open the viewfinder, allowing them to use it for free. When they get a closer view of the last couple available, a man and a woman under a tree, Rachel gets distressed when they start kissing and puts an end to their game, telling Chloe she needs to get drunk. They'll then go to the other side of the park, where a couple is having a picnic and have a bottle of wine on their table. Rachel approaches the couple and starts acting sick, throwing herself to the ground and pretending to be in need of resuscitation. Chloe can encourage the man to help her, either succeeding or failing on doing so resulting in the man ""saving"" Rachel's life or the woman seeing through their ploy. Whatever the outcome is, the two girls will get the wine. After this, they're shown walking on the train tracks. Chloe invites Rachel to explore a junkyard nearby and Rachel lets her explore on her own. After a long conversation between the two, no matter what choices the player has made so far, Rachel will leave, but not before Chloe tries to convince her to stay. Chloe has the option to say that they have a real friendship or something more. Once Rachel leaves, Chloe gets angry and breaks everything around her. She then has a meltdown upon seeing her late father's car. She'll fall asleep and have another dream about her father, this time, with him advising/warning her on her relationship with Rachel, in which Chloe will see Rachel outside of the car, who will then catch fire. When she wakes up, it's already night and she goes back to the overlook where she finds Rachel. Upon a brief dialogue, in which Rachel reveals the man they had seen at the park was her dad, and that he was cheating on her mother with that woman. Rachel takes out a photo of her as a kid with her father, asks Chloe for her lighter which she uses it burn the photo, throwing it into a nearby trash bin, and starting a wildfire by kicking the bin into a tree nearby. Rachel then screams, increasing the fire's intensity. The episode ends showing each character's reaction to the wildfire seen in the sky.

Both Rachel and Chloe are questioned about their absence the day before. The conversation varies depending on how Chloe treated Joyce, if she sabotaged Victoria's homework, if she went onstage and smoked weed, whether she helped Nathan or not, and if she won or lost the backtalk against Drew (if she helped Nathan). Rachel claims their misbehavior was her idea, and as punishment, is removed as Wells' administrative assistant and her role as Prospera in The Tempest. If Chloe goes along with Rachel, she will be suspended. If Chloe takes the blame for Rachel, she will be expelled, but Rachel won't be removed from the play. After they leave the office, Skip Matthews escorts Chloe to her locker, so she can clean it out. Chloe searches for her hidden joint but discovers Justin Williams has taken it. Angry, Chloe lies to Skip that she has to use the bathroom. Meanwhile, Joyce speaks with Rachel's parents, James, and Rose Amber. Once inside, she proceeds to tag it from ceiling to floor, venting her frustration. She then exits and Victoria approaches the bathroom, looking dumbfounded as she opens the door. Chloe enters the parking lot of Blackwell Academy. She can optionally talk to Eliot, who will feel sympathy for her expulsion or suspension and offer her a hug. He will again ask her if she wants to go to the play with him. Chloe walks to the car where Joyce and David are waiting for her; David asks her to empty her pockets on the hood of the car. David later announces that he will be moving in with them. This outrages Chloe and she storms off. David stops Joyce from going after her, wanting to give her some time to get over her anger. Chloe goes to the junkyard and knocks over items with her bat until she notices a very old truck. She scours the junkyard for various items needed to fix the truck: a battery from an impounded truck (which requires having to press a button to unlock the hood); something to cover the hole in the floor: a rug, a welcome mat, or a golf mat; a new light bulb from either a fish tank, a toy robot, or a Christmas wreath; and something to cover the torn seat: a pirate flag or a beach towel. She can also optionally decorate the truck using an Elvis Presley bobblehead found in a small box somewhere in the junkyard and draw a decoration on the back of the seat. Despite all her hard work, the truck still remains inoperational. She then relaxes in the driver's seat and smokes a cigarette. Chloe finds herself in another one of her dreams. She finds William, her deceased father, roasting marshmallows in the burning wreckage of his car. She sits next to him and roasts marshmallows too, as he warns her about the danger of fire, a metaphor for Rachel Amber. The dream ends with William's face being shown half-burnt with a raven pecking at his face. Chloe wakes up to find Rachel tapping on the window of her car, carrying a duffel bag. Rachel gets inside the car and the two have a ""therapy session"" (which will vary depending on if Rachel was removed from the play or not): they discuss their feelings about the current events in their life and how unhappy they are with them. Rachel leaves and gives Chloe her duffel bag, which is full of clothes. Chloe receives a call from Frank Bowers, who wants to meet up with her. Chloe enters the Hideout in the junkyard. She can optionally spruce up the place and then changes into one of Rachel's outfits. Frank approaches in his RV. Chloe sees a woman leaving the vehicle. She enters Frank's RV and he drives away. He asks her to retrieve his account book. Chloe opens the door to his bedroom, and Pompidou runs out. She takes his account book and brings it to him. Chloe then asks Frank about the woman, but he refuses to say anything. Frank reveals that Drew North runs Oxy for Damon Merrick and he owes him $1,000. He asks her to go to the school to find the money and bring it to him. After Frank drops off Chloe, she can speak with Steph Gingrich, Evan Harris, and Samuel Taylor. She shoos away a bird that Evan is photographing to distract him long enough for Chloe to damage a nearby sprinkler. This gets Samuel's attention and while he goes to fix the sprinkler, Chloe takes his keys and uses it to unlock the dorm, but encounters Skip. An argument begins, which will earn either Skip's trust or anger before he leaves to deal with an unauthorized vehicle in the parking lot (presumably Frank's RV). After she enters Drew and Mikey's room, she must figure out the combination to a locked trunk containing the money. If she fails too many times, she will get help from Steph. After getting the money, she is caught by Mikey and Drew (who are preparing to leave), followed by the arrival of Damon. Drew goes out to talk to him while telling Chloe not to leave the room. Upon hearing Damon beat up Drew, Chloe must choose whether to intervene or stay in the room, which will lead Drew to be glad for staying out of the way or upset for interfering. If she stays out of the fight, Drew will get injured and after Damon leaves, Chloe must choose to give the money to Drew or keep it. If she intervenes, Mikey will get hurt instead and Chloe will hand the money over to Damon, who then leaves. It is now late afternoon and Blackwell begins to start the play. Chloe can find Samantha Myers overhearing Nathan Prescott talking with his father, who wants his son to get over his fear and not humiliate him. Chloe can choose whether to talk to him or keep quiet. She can then convince Samantha to cheer for Nathan and can also encourage Nathan, be sarcastic towards him, or do nothing. Afterwards, she can talk to Hayden Jones, Dana Ward, and Travis Keaton and has the option of playing with the spotlights. In the changing room, Chloe will face a situation between Rachel and Victoria which varies depending on if Rachel was dropped from the play or not. If Rachel was removed from the play, this will lead to either Chloe getting Victoria to drop from the play via backtalk or Rachel drugging Victoria's tea if Chloe was nice to Victoria or lost the backtalk. If Rachel wasn't removed, Victoria will drug Rachel's tea instead. Chloe can either warn Rachel or distract Victoria. If she warns Rachel, she will get Victoria to drink the drugged tea by pretending to believe her. If Chloe distracts Victoria, she will temporally leave and Chloe will switch the cups, leading Victoria to drink the drugged tea upon returning. Keaton later informs the students that Juliet Watson, who was meant to play as Ariel, is delayed by the wildfire that Rachel caused and can't make it in time. Following this, Victoria will then either drop from the play (in which Rachel will then volunteer to take over for Victoria) or fall unconscious. Rachel then convinces a reluctant Chloe to take over for Juliet. As Chloe and Rachel perform onstage as Prospera and Ariel, Nathan then comes in, who will either leave in embarrassment or have confidence and play out his role. Juliet later arrives and replaces Chloe's spot in the play. At the end of the play, Rachel, Hayden, Dana, Juliet, Keaton, and Nathan all come out and bow to the audience, with Rachel bringing Chloe out to join the other performers. The mysterious woman from earlier is seen watching them from a distance. Rachel and Chloe are next seen wandering down a street together. Rachel is happy about the play and how Chloe took part in it. The two then discuss their plan to leave Arcadia Bay, in which Chloe can either receive Rachel's bracelet, a promise for a tattoo, or a kiss. After the conversation, they then head to Rachel's house to pick up clothes. Rachel and Chloe attempt to sneak upstairs but are caught by James. When James compliments her performance, her mood changes, and she despondently replies ""thanks"". Rachel heads upstairs to freshen up, leaving Chloe with her parents. Chloe then helps Rose set up plates and cups for the dinner table, question James of what he wants to drink (in which he will ask for Sherry), and light the candles on the table with her lighter. The four all sit down for dinner and Rachel's parents begin talking about the forest fire and the reports that it was arson. The conversation soon turns into an argument when Rachel's anger visibly increases throughout James's lecture. Chloe can either calm Rachel down or attack James on his misdeeds with her backtalk. Whichever option is chosen, Rachel will lose her temper and call James out. When Chloe and Rose join in the argument, Rachel begins to dissociate and eventually throws a salad bowl through the table, smashing it. She screams at James to tell her the truth. James tells her that the woman he kissed was not his mistress, but is in fact, Rachel's biological mother. The episode ends with scenes showing Steph at the hospital to see Drew and Mikey, Joyce embracing David in despair upon seeing that Chloe hasn't returned, Rachel's biological mother smoking a cigarette, Damon approaching Frank (how they will react depends on whether Chloe gave the money to Damon, Drew, or kept it), Victoria looking at a Tempest poster the dressing room before stepping on it and leaving, Samantha approaching Nathan, and the wildfire still happening in the distance.

Both Rachel and Chloe are questioned about their absence the day before .
The conversation varies depending on how Chloe treated Joyce , if she sabotaged Victoria 's homework , if she went onstage and smoked weed , whether she helped Nathan or not , and if she won or lost the backtalk against Drew ( if she helped Nathan ) .

Chloe goes to the junkyard and knocks over items with her bat until she notices a very old truck .
She scours the junkyard for various items needed to fix the truck : a battery from an impounded truck ( which requires having to press a button to unlock the hood ) ; something to cover the hole in the floor : a rug , a welcome mat , or a golf mat ; a new light bulb from either a fish tank , a toy robot , or a Christmas wreath ; and something to cover the torn seat : a pirate flag or a beach towel .
She can also optionally decorate the truck using an Elvis Presley bobblehead found in a small box somewhere in the junkyard and draw a decoration on the back of the seat .
Despite all her hard work , the truck still remains inoperational .
She then relaxes in the driver 's seat and smokes a cigarette .
Chloe finds herself in another one of her dreams .
She finds William , her deceased father , roasting marshmallows in the burning wreckage of his car .
She sits next to him and roasts marshmallows too , as he warns her about the danger of fire , a metaphor for Rachel Amber .

This gets Samuel 's attention and while he goes to fix the sprinkler , Chloe takes his keys and uses it to unlock the dorm , but encounters Skip .
An argument begins , which will earn either Skip 's trust or anger before he leaves to deal with an unauthorized vehicle in the parking lot ( presumably Frank 's RV ) .

[EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Rachel looks awesome...","The episode starts with a hooded Chloe Price smoking a cigarette and standing at the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to come. After its passage, she takes off her hood and goes towards the old mill, ignoring the ""No Trespassing"" sign after jumping over a fence. In order to get inside the mill, she starts an argument with the bouncer, in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails. After entering, she can interact with people, objects, graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money (or not). If she steals the money, she'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later. After this, she'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys, the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her. However, she'll manage to see the band by going upstairs, even with the floor there being rotten. She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her. She's saved by Rachel Amber, in her very first appearance, and will have the first major choice of the game: attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing. After running downstairs, the two girls stop and look at Frank, who notices what's going to happen and quickly stops the guys, causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill. Rachel pulls Chloe along with her, and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night. The next morning, Chloe is shown waking up in her room, at the Price household. She sits up and takes her red 'Oregon' ashtray and starts smoking a cigarette (or weed, if she bought it from Frank earlier with the stolen money). Chloe can look at a photo of her and Max Caulfield as kids along with her dad, William Price and can also look at her diary. After being called by her mother, Joyce Price, for breakfast downstairs, she'll get up from her bed and will be able to interact with many objects around her room. She'll change clothes before leaving her room (the player gets to choose her outfit). Due to having drunk too much, Chloe notices her phone is missing. She then goes to her mother's room to call her phone with her mother's phone. There, she can interact with another object before using her mother's phone. By doing this, Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom, and just after she takes it, her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone, causing her to go back to the room. When she finally goes downstairs, she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on. She'll then talk with her mother about several topics, and at the end of the conversation, she'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels. Depending on her choice, Joyce will be either kind or tough towards her. Chloe'll have to pick the keys from her stepfather, David Madsen, and take them to him since he'll be taking her to school today. After leaving the house and going to David, he'll ask her to get the tools he needs to fix his car in the garage. After this, she gets in the car and David will try to start a conversation with her. She can either start a fight with him or listen to what he has to say.

Both Rachel and Chloe are questioned about their absence the day before. The conversation varies depending on how Chloe treated Joyce, if she sabotaged Victoria's homework, if she went onstage and smoked weed, whether she helped Nathan or not, and if she won or lost the backtalk against Drew (if she helped Nathan). Rachel claims their misbehavior was her idea, and as punishment, is removed as Wells' administrative assistant and her role as Prospera in The Tempest. If Chloe goes along with Rachel, she will be suspended. If Chloe takes the blame for Rachel, she will be expelled, but Rachel won't be removed from the play. After they leave the office, Skip Matthews escorts Chloe to her locker, so she can clean it out. Chloe searches for her hidden joint but discovers Justin Williams has taken it. Angry, Chloe lies to Skip that she has to use the bathroom. Meanwhile, Joyce speaks with Rachel's parents, James, and Rose Amber. Once inside, she proceeds to tag it from ceiling to floor, venting her frustration. She then exits and Victoria approaches the bathroom, looking dumbfounded as she opens the door. Chloe enters the parking lot of Blackwell Academy. She can optionally talk to Eliot, who will feel sympathy for her expulsion or suspension and offer her a hug. He will again ask her if she wants to go to the play with him. Chloe walks to the car where Joyce and David are waiting for her; David asks her to empty her pockets on the hood of the car. David later announces that he will be moving in with them. This outrages Chloe and she storms off. David stops Joyce from going after her, wanting to give her some time to get over her anger. Chloe goes to the junkyard and knocks over items with her bat until she notices a very old truck. She scours the junkyard for various items needed to fix the truck: a battery from an impounded truck (which requires having to press a button to unlock the hood); something to cover the hole in the floor: a rug, a welcome mat, or a golf mat; a new light bulb from either a fish tank, a toy robot, or a Christmas wreath; and something to cover the torn seat: a pirate flag or a beach towel. She can also optionally decorate the truck using an Elvis Presley bobblehead found in a small box somewhere in the junkyard and draw a decoration on the back of the seat. Despite all her hard work, the truck still remains inoperational. She then relaxes in the driver's seat and smokes a cigarette. Chloe finds herself in another one of her dreams. She finds William, her deceased father, roasting marshmallows in the burning wreckage of his car. She sits next to him and roasts marshmallows too, as he warns her about the danger of fire, a metaphor for Rachel Amber. The dream ends with William's face being shown half-burnt with a raven pecking at his face. Chloe wakes up to find Rachel tapping on the window of her car, carrying a duffel bag. Rachel gets inside the car and the two have a ""therapy session"" (which will vary depending on if Rachel was removed from the play or not): they discuss their feelings about the current events in their life and how unhappy they are with them. Rachel leaves and gives Chloe her duffel bag, which is full of clothes. Chloe receives a call from Frank Bowers, who wants to meet up with her. Chloe enters the Hideout in the junkyard. She can optionally spruce up the place and then changes into one of Rachel's outfits. Frank approaches in his RV. Chloe sees a woman leaving the vehicle. She enters Frank's RV and he drives away. He asks her to retrieve his account book. Chloe opens the door to his bedroom, and Pompidou runs out. She takes his account book and brings it to him. Chloe then asks Frank about the woman, but he refuses to say anything. Frank reveals that Drew North runs Oxy for Damon Merrick and he owes him $1,000. He asks her to go to the school to find the money and bring it to him. After Frank drops off Chloe, she can speak with Steph Gingrich, Evan Harris, and Samuel Taylor. She shoos away a bird that Evan is photographing to distract him long enough for Chloe to damage a nearby sprinkler. This gets Samuel's attention and while he goes to fix the sprinkler, Chloe takes his keys and uses it to unlock the dorm, but encounters Skip. An argument begins, which will earn either Skip's trust or anger before he leaves to deal with an unauthorized vehicle in the parking lot (presumably Frank's RV). After she enters Drew and Mikey's room, she must figure out the combination to a locked trunk containing the money. If she fails too many times, she will get help from Steph. After getting the money, she is caught by Mikey and Drew (who are preparing to leave), followed by the arrival of Damon. Drew goes out to talk to him while telling Chloe not to leave the room. Upon hearing Damon beat up Drew, Chloe must choose whether to intervene or stay in the room, which will lead Drew to be glad for staying out of the way or upset for interfering. If she stays out of the fight, Drew will get injured and after Damon leaves, Chloe must choose to give the money to Drew or keep it. If she intervenes, Mikey will get hurt instead and Chloe will hand the money over to Damon, who then leaves. It is now late afternoon and Blackwell begins to start the play. Chloe can find Samantha Myers overhearing Nathan Prescott talking with his father, who wants his son to get over his fear and not humiliate him. Chloe can choose whether to talk to him or keep quiet. She can then convince Samantha to cheer for Nathan and can also encourage Nathan, be sarcastic towards him, or do nothing. Afterwards, she can talk to Hayden Jones, Dana Ward, and Travis Keaton and has the option of playing with the spotlights. In the changing room, Chloe will face a situation between Rachel and Victoria which varies depending on if Rachel was dropped from the play or not. If Rachel was removed from the play, this will lead to either Chloe getting Victoria to drop from the play via backtalk or Rachel drugging Victoria's tea if Chloe was nice to Victoria or lost the backtalk. If Rachel wasn't removed, Victoria will drug Rachel's tea instead. Chloe can either warn Rachel or distract Victoria. If she warns Rachel, she will get Victoria to drink the drugged tea by pretending to believe her. If Chloe distracts Victoria, she will temporally leave and Chloe will switch the cups, leading Victoria to drink the drugged tea upon returning. Keaton later informs the students that Juliet Watson, who was meant to play as Ariel, is delayed by the wildfire that Rachel caused and can't make it in time. Following this, Victoria will then either drop from the play (in which Rachel will then volunteer to take over for Victoria) or fall unconscious. Rachel then convinces a reluctant Chloe to take over for Juliet. As Chloe and Rachel perform onstage as Prospera and Ariel, Nathan then comes in, who will either leave in embarrassment or have confidence and play out his role. Juliet later arrives and replaces Chloe's spot in the play. At the end of the play, Rachel, Hayden, Dana, Juliet, Keaton, and Nathan all come out and bow to the audience, with Rachel bringing Chloe out to join the other performers. The mysterious woman from earlier is seen watching them from a distance. Rachel and Chloe are next seen wandering down a street together. Rachel is happy about the play and how Chloe took part in it. The two then discuss their plan to leave Arcadia Bay, in which Chloe can either receive Rachel's bracelet, a promise for a tattoo, or a kiss. After the conversation, they then head to Rachel's house to pick up clothes. Rachel and Chloe attempt to sneak upstairs but are caught by James. When James compliments her performance, her mood changes, and she despondently replies ""thanks"". Rachel heads upstairs to freshen up, leaving Chloe with her parents. Chloe then helps Rose set up plates and cups for the dinner table, question James of what he wants to drink (in which he will ask for Sherry), and light the candles on the table with her lighter. The four all sit down for dinner and Rachel's parents begin talking about the forest fire and the reports that it was arson. The conversation soon turns into an argument when Rachel's anger visibly increases throughout James's lecture. Chloe can either calm Rachel down or attack James on his misdeeds with her backtalk. Whichever option is chosen, Rachel will lose her temper and call James out. When Chloe and Rose join in the argument, Rachel begins to dissociate and eventually throws a salad bowl through the table, smashing it. She screams at James to tell her the truth. James tells her that the woman he kissed was not his mistress, but is in fact, Rachel's biological mother. The episode ends with scenes showing Steph at the hospital to see Drew and Mikey, Joyce embracing David in despair upon seeing that Chloe hasn't returned, Rachel's biological mother smoking a cigarette, Damon approaching Frank (how they will react depends on whether Chloe gave the money to Damon, Drew, or kept it), Victoria looking at a Tempest poster the dressing room before stepping on it and leaving, Samantha approaching Nathan, and the wildfire still happening in the distance.

[EX]   S0 : CHOICE: (Didn't see the photo Rachel posted)  [EX]   CHLOE : Who exactly is talking shit about me?","The episode starts with a hooded Chloe Price smoking a cigarette and standing at the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to come. After its passage, she takes off her hood and goes towards the old mill, ignoring the ""No Trespassing"" sign after jumping over a fence. In order to get inside the mill, she starts an argument with the bouncer, in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails. After entering, she can interact with people, objects, graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money (or not). If she steals the money, she'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later. After this, she'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys, the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her. However, she'll manage to see the band by going upstairs, even with the floor there being rotten. She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her. She's saved by Rachel Amber, in her very first appearance, and will have the first major choice of the game: attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing. After running downstairs, the two girls stop and look at Frank, who notices what's going to happen and quickly stops the guys, causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill. Rachel pulls Chloe along with her, and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night. The next morning, Chloe is shown waking up in her room, at the Price household. She sits up and takes her red 'Oregon' ashtray and starts smoking a cigarette (or weed, if she bought it from Frank earlier with the stolen money). Chloe can look at a photo of her and Max Caulfield as kids along with her dad, William Price and can also look at her diary. After being called by her mother, Joyce Price, for breakfast downstairs, she'll get up from her bed and will be able to interact with many objects around her room. She'll change clothes before leaving her room (the player gets to choose her outfit). Due to having drunk too much, Chloe notices her phone is missing. She then goes to her mother's room to call her phone with her mother's phone. There, she can interact with another object before using her mother's phone. By doing this, Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom, and just after she takes it, her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone, causing her to go back to the room. When she finally goes downstairs, she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on. She'll then talk with her mother about several topics, and at the end of the conversation, she'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels. Depending on her choice, Joyce will be either kind or tough towards her. Chloe'll have to pick the keys from her stepfather, David Madsen, and take them to him since he'll be taking her to school today. After leaving the house and going to David, he'll ask her to get the tools he needs to fix his car in the garage. After this, she gets in the car and David will try to start a conversation with her. She can either start a fight with him or listen to what he has to say. After the talk, Chloe will fall asleep and have a weird dream about being in a car with her dad, going to pick up her mom from the grocery store. The dream abruptly ends with a truck crashing through William's car. When she wakes up, she's already at Blackwell Academy.

Afterwards, she'll go towards the school entrance, but she'll be interrupted by Drew North and Nathan Prescott, who are starting a fight. A student called Samantha Myers urges Chloe to do something to help Nathan, and Chloe can either backtalk Drew and defend Nathan or just ignore them, which will cause Samantha to either thank Chloe or be upset with her for not helping. When the fight is over, she can finally enter the school, and just as she opens the door, Rachel appears on the other side and pulls her along with her to the Drama Lab where Travis Keaton is rehearsing with Dana Ward and Hayden Jones.

When they get a closer view of the last couple available, a man and a woman under a tree, Rachel gets distressed when they start kissing and puts an end to their game, telling Chloe she needs to get drunk. They'll then go to the other side of the park, where a couple is having a picnic and have a bottle of wine on their table. Rachel approaches the couple and starts acting sick, throwing herself to the ground and pretending to be in need of resuscitation. Chloe can encourage the man to help her, either succeeding or failing on doing so resulting in the man ""saving"" Rachel's life or the woman seeing through their ploy. Whatever the outcome is, the two girls will get the wine. After this, they're shown walking on the train tracks. Chloe invites Rachel to explore a junkyard nearby and Rachel lets her explore on her own. After a long conversation between the two, no matter what choices the player has made so far, Rachel will leave, but not before Chloe tries to convince her to stay. Chloe has the option to say that they have a real friendship or something more. Once Rachel leaves, Chloe gets angry and breaks everything around her. She then has a meltdown upon seeing her late father's car. She'll fall asleep and have another dream about her father, this time, with him advising/warning her on her relationship with Rachel, in which Chloe will see Rachel outside of the car, who will then catch fire. When she wakes up, it's already night and she goes back to the overlook where she finds Rachel.

Both Rachel and Chloe are questioned about their absence the day before. The conversation varies depending on how Chloe treated Joyce, if she sabotaged Victoria's homework, if she went onstage and smoked weed, whether she helped Nathan or not, and if she won or lost the backtalk against Drew (if she helped Nathan). Rachel claims their misbehavior was her idea, and as punishment, is removed as Wells' administrative assistant and her role as Prospera in The Tempest. If Chloe goes along with Rachel, she will be suspended. If Chloe takes the blame for Rachel, she will be expelled, but Rachel won't be removed from the play. After they leave the office, Skip Matthews escorts Chloe to her locker, so she can clean it out. Chloe searches for her hidden joint but discovers Justin Williams has taken it. Angry, Chloe lies to Skip that she has to use the bathroom. Meanwhile, Joyce speaks with Rachel's parents, James, and Rose Amber. Once inside, she proceeds to tag it from ceiling to floor, venting her frustration. She then exits and Victoria approaches the bathroom, looking dumbfounded as she opens the door. Chloe enters the parking lot of Blackwell Academy. She can optionally talk to Eliot, who will feel sympathy for her expulsion or suspension and offer her a hug. He will again ask her if she wants to go to the play with him. Chloe walks to the car where Joyce and David are waiting for her; David asks her to empty her pockets on the hood of the car. David later announces that he will be moving in with them. This outrages Chloe and she storms off. David stops Joyce from going after her, wanting to give her some time to get over her anger. Chloe goes to the junkyard and knocks over items with her bat until she notices a very old truck. She scours the junkyard for various items needed to fix the truck: a battery from an impounded truck (which requires having to press a button to unlock the hood); something to cover the hole in the floor: a rug, a welcome mat, or a golf mat; a new light bulb from either a fish tank, a toy robot, or a Christmas wreath; and something to cover the torn seat: a pirate flag or a beach towel. She can also optionally decorate the truck using an Elvis Presley bobblehead found in a small box somewhere in the junkyard and draw a decoration on the back of the seat. Despite all her hard work, the truck still remains inoperational. She then relaxes in the driver's seat and smokes a cigarette. Chloe finds herself in another one of her dreams. She finds William, her deceased father, roasting marshmallows in the burning wreckage of his car. She sits next to him and roasts marshmallows too, as he warns her about the danger of fire, a metaphor for Rachel Amber. The dream ends with William's face being shown half-burnt with a raven pecking at his face. Chloe wakes up to find Rachel tapping on the window of her car, carrying a duffel bag. Rachel gets inside the car and the two have a ""therapy session"" (which will vary depending on if Rachel was removed from the play or not): they discuss their feelings about the current events in their life and how unhappy they are with them. Rachel leaves and gives Chloe her duffel bag, which is full of clothes. Chloe receives a call from Frank Bowers, who wants to meet up with her. Chloe enters the Hideout in the junkyard. She can optionally spruce up the place and then changes into one of Rachel's outfits. Frank approaches in his RV. Chloe sees a woman leaving the vehicle. She enters Frank's RV and he drives away. He asks her to retrieve his account book. Chloe opens the door to his bedroom, and Pompidou runs out. She takes his account book and brings it to him. Chloe then asks Frank about the woman, but he refuses to say anything. Frank reveals that Drew North runs Oxy for Damon Merrick and he owes him $1,000. He asks her to go to the school to find the money and bring it to him. After Frank drops off Chloe, she can speak with Steph Gingrich, Evan Harris, and Samuel Taylor. She shoos away a bird that Evan is photographing to distract him long enough for Chloe to damage a nearby sprinkler. This gets Samuel's attention and while he goes to fix the sprinkler, Chloe takes his keys and uses it to unlock the dorm, but encounters Skip. An argument begins, which will earn either Skip's trust or anger before he leaves to deal with an unauthorized vehicle in the parking lot (presumably Frank's RV). After she enters Drew and Mikey's room, she must figure out the combination to a locked trunk containing the money. If she fails too many times, she will get help from Steph. After getting the money, she is caught by Mikey and Drew (who are preparing to leave), followed by the arrival of Damon. Drew goes out to talk to him while telling Chloe not to leave the room. Upon hearing Damon beat up Drew, Chloe must choose whether to intervene or stay in the room, which will lead Drew to be glad for staying out of the way or upset for interfering. If she stays out of the fight, Drew will get injured and after Damon leaves, Chloe must choose to give the money to Drew or keep it. If she intervenes, Mikey will get hurt instead and Chloe will hand the money over to Damon, who then leaves. It is now late afternoon and Blackwell begins to start the play. Chloe can find Samantha Myers overhearing Nathan Prescott talking with his father, who wants his son to get over his fear and not humiliate him. Chloe can choose whether to talk to him or keep quiet. She can then convince Samantha to cheer for Nathan and can also encourage Nathan, be sarcastic towards him, or do nothing. Afterwards, she can talk to Hayden Jones, Dana Ward, and Travis Keaton and has the option of playing with the spotlights. In the changing room, Chloe will face a situation between Rachel and Victoria which varies depending on if Rachel was dropped from the play or not. If Rachel was removed from the play, this will lead to either Chloe getting Victoria to drop from the play via backtalk or Rachel drugging Victoria's tea if Chloe was nice to Victoria or lost the backtalk. If Rachel wasn't removed, Victoria will drug Rachel's tea instead. Chloe can either warn Rachel or distract Victoria. If she warns Rachel, she will get Victoria to drink the drugged tea by pretending to believe her. If Chloe distracts Victoria, she will temporally leave and Chloe will switch the cups, leading Victoria to drink the drugged tea upon returning. Keaton later informs the students that Juliet Watson, who was meant to play as Ariel, is delayed by the wildfire that Rachel caused and can't make it in time. Following this, Victoria will then either drop from the play (in which Rachel will then volunteer to take over for Victoria) or fall unconscious. Rachel then convinces a reluctant Chloe to take over for Juliet. As Chloe and Rachel perform onstage as Prospera and Ariel, Nathan then comes in, who will either leave in embarrassment or have confidence and play out his role. Juliet later arrives and replaces Chloe's spot in the play. At the end of the play, Rachel, Hayden, Dana, Juliet, Keaton, and Nathan all come out and bow to the audience, with Rachel bringing Chloe out to join the other performers. The mysterious woman from earlier is seen watching them from a distance. Rachel and Chloe are next seen wandering down a street together. Rachel is happy about the play and how Chloe took part in it. The two then discuss their plan to leave Arcadia Bay, in which Chloe can either receive Rachel's bracelet, a promise for a tattoo, or a kiss. After the conversation, they then head to Rachel's house to pick up clothes. Rachel and Chloe attempt to sneak upstairs but are caught by James. When James compliments her performance, her mood changes, and she despondently replies ""thanks"". Rachel heads upstairs to freshen up, leaving Chloe with her parents. Chloe then helps Rose set up plates and cups for the dinner table, question James of what he wants to drink (in which he will ask for Sherry), and light the candles on the table with her lighter. The four all sit down for dinner and Rachel's parents begin talking about the forest fire and the reports that it was arson. The conversation soon turns into an argument when Rachel's anger visibly increases throughout James's lecture. Chloe can either calm Rachel down or attack James on his misdeeds with her backtalk. Whichever option is chosen, Rachel will lose her temper and call James out. When Chloe and Rose join in the argument, Rachel begins to dissociate and eventually throws a salad bowl through the table, smashing it. She screams at James to tell her the truth. James tells her that the woman he kissed was not his mistress, but is in fact, Rachel's biological mother. The episode ends with scenes showing Steph at the hospital to see Drew and Mikey, Joyce embracing David in despair upon seeing that Chloe hasn't returned, Rachel's biological mother smoking a cigarette, Damon approaching Frank (how they will react depends on whether Chloe gave the money to Damon, Drew, or kept it), Victoria looking at a Tempest poster the dressing room before stepping on it and leaving, Samantha approaching Nathan, and the wildfire still happening in the distance.

[EX]   S0 : CHOICE: (Didn't see the photo Rachel posted)  [EX]   CHLOE : Who exactly is talking shit about me?
[EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Rachel looks awesome...","The episode starts with a hooded Chloe Price smoking a cigarette and standing at the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to come. After its passage, she takes off her hood and goes towards the old mill, ignoring the ""No Trespassing"" sign after jumping over a fence. In order to get inside the mill, she starts an argument with the bouncer, in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails. After entering, she can interact with people, objects, graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money (or not). If she steals the money, she'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later. After this, she'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys, the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her. However, she'll manage to see the band by going upstairs, even with the floor there being rotten. She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her. She's saved by Rachel Amber, in her very first appearance, and will have the first major choice of the game: attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing. After running downstairs, the two girls stop and look at Frank, who notices what's going to happen and quickly stops the guys, causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill. Rachel pulls Chloe along with her, and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night. The next morning, Chloe is shown waking up in her room, at the Price household. She sits up and takes her red 'Oregon' ashtray and starts smoking a cigarette (or weed, if she bought it from Frank earlier with the stolen money). Chloe can look at a photo of her and Max Caulfield as kids along with her dad, William Price and can also look at her diary. After being called by her mother, Joyce Price, for breakfast downstairs, she'll get up from her bed and will be able to interact with many objects around her room. She'll change clothes before leaving her room (the player gets to choose her outfit). Due to having drunk too much, Chloe notices her phone is missing. She then goes to her mother's room to call her phone with her mother's phone. There, she can interact with another object before using her mother's phone. By doing this, Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom, and just after she takes it, her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone, causing her to go back to the room. When she finally goes downstairs, she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on. She'll then talk with her mother about several topics, and at the end of the conversation, she'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels. Depending on her choice, Joyce will be either kind or tough towards her. Chloe'll have to pick the keys from her stepfather, David Madsen, and take them to him since he'll be taking her to school today. After leaving the house and going to David, he'll ask her to get the tools he needs to fix his car in the garage. After this, she gets in the car and David will try to start a conversation with her. She can either start a fight with him or listen to what he has to say. After the talk, Chloe will fall asleep and have a weird dream about being in a car with her dad, going to pick up her mom from the grocery store. The dream abruptly ends with a truck crashing through William's car. When she wakes up, she's already at Blackwell Academy. There, she can talk to Eliot Hampden (and choose whether or not she wants to watch The Tempest play with him), Victoria Chase (with the option of sabotaging her homework if doing so), Skip Matthews (with the option of listening to the demo of his band, PissHead, and giving him your opinion on it if doing so), Principal Wells (only if she sits on a crate on the stage and with the option of starting a backtalk challenge with him if doing so), Michelle Grant, Mikey North and Steph Gingrich (in order to get her DVD and with the additional option of playing a tabletop game with them), and other students. Afterwards, she'll go towards the school entrance, but she'll be interrupted by Drew North and Nathan Prescott, who are starting a fight. A student called Samantha Myers urges Chloe to do something to help Nathan, and Chloe can either backtalk Drew and defend Nathan or just ignore them, which will cause Samantha to either thank Chloe or be upset with her for not helping. When the fight is over, she can finally enter the school, and just as she opens the door, Rachel appears on the other side and pulls her along with her to the Drama Lab where Travis Keaton is rehearsing with Dana Ward and Hayden Jones. Rachel will ask for her opinion on Miranda's love for Fernando, both portrayed by Dana and Hayden respectively in ""The Tempest"" play, and Chloe can choose whether to say it's true love or not. After the class is over, everyone will leave the room, except for Chloe and Rachel. Rachel will change to normal clothes and ask Chloe to get her belt from her bag and bring it to her. After doing this, they'll have a short conversation before Rachel invites Chloe to skip school, and they end up in a train carriage where, after finding some crates to sit on, they play the game Two Truths and a Lie. Chloe can either cheat or follow the game rules. After their game, Chloe will have the option of sharing or not her earbuds with Rachel during their trip. Upon arriving at Overlook Park, they'll play another game using the viewfinders to spy on people around the park. However, the viewfinder that they intend to use it broken. Chloe asks Rachel for something sharp like a knife and she gives her a nail file, which Chloe uses to unscrew a deducation plate from a park bench and then uses it to break open the viewfinder, allowing them to use it for free. When they get a closer view of the last couple available, a man and a woman under a tree, Rachel gets distressed when they start kissing and puts an end to their game, telling Chloe she needs to get drunk. They'll then go to the other side of the park, where a couple is having a picnic and have a bottle of wine on their table. Rachel approaches the couple and starts acting sick, throwing herself to the ground and pretending to be in need of resuscitation. Chloe can encourage the man to help her, either succeeding or failing on doing so resulting in the man ""saving"" Rachel's life or the woman seeing through their ploy. Whatever the outcome is, the two girls will get the wine. After this, they're shown walking on the train tracks. Chloe invites Rachel to explore a junkyard nearby and Rachel lets her explore on her own. After a long conversation between the two, no matter what choices the player has made so far, Rachel will leave, but not before Chloe tries to convince her to stay. Chloe has the option to say that they have a real friendship or something more. Once Rachel leaves, Chloe gets angry and breaks everything around her. She then has a meltdown upon seeing her late father's car. She'll fall asleep and have another dream about her father, this time, with him advising/warning her on her relationship with Rachel, in which Chloe will see Rachel outside of the car, who will then catch fire. When she wakes up, it's already night and she goes back to the overlook where she finds Rachel. Upon a brief dialogue, in which Rachel reveals the man they had seen at the park was her dad, and that he was cheating on her mother with that woman. Rachel takes out a photo of her as a kid with her father, asks Chloe for her lighter which she uses it burn the photo, throwing it into a nearby trash bin, and starting a wildfire by kicking the bin into a tree nearby. Rachel then screams, increasing the fire's intensity. The episode ends showing each character's reaction to the wildfire seen in the sky.

[EX]   S0 : CHOICE: (Gave money to Damon)  [EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Plus he likes me, and he owes me one from yesterday.
[EX]   S0 : CHOICE: (Won backtalk challenge with Frank)  [EX]   CHLOE : I need to find that woman from yesterday, Sera.","Continuing from the last episode where Chloe Price is at Rachel Amber's house for dinner when Rachel accuses her father of cheating, James Amber reveals that the woman he was with in the park was Rachel's real mother, Sera Gearhardt. He then tells them the whole story, in which Chloe and Rachel then find themselves in a dark area with a viewfinder. As James tells the story, they look through the viewfinder, which shows them visuals of how Sera and James met in high school and fell in love. They had a child together (Rachel) but Sera became a drug addict. Growing fearful of Sera's behavior, James eventually left with the child and made an agreement with Sera to pay her monthly if she agreed to stay away. This worked for 15 years. Rachel is devastated and wants to meet Sera, but has no idea how to find her before heading upstairs. Chloe agrees to help (against James's wishes) and goes to Rachel's room, where she finds Rachel laying in bed and is still upset with her father's lies. After using a flashlight from a toolbox and a star globe from a night light to form a starry night, Chloe is able to talk to Rachel, promising to help find Sera. Chloe then has another dream where she is onstage in her Ariel costume on some seats that are arranged to look like car seats. William is sitting in the front row of seats, acting like he is driving. He explains the reason why people keep secrets: to keep their loved ones safe. The dream ends with an actual truck appearing onstage and crushing William, causing Chloe to fall in depression while Victoria can be heard booing her. The next morning, she returns home (in which she may discover that David had searched through her room depending on decisions made in the previous episodes) and calls Frank Bowers, who reluctantly agrees to meet Chloe at the junkyard. While heading downstairs, she sees Joyce and David embracing each other. When she tries to sneak pass them, they see her. David reveals that he has decided to trust Chloe more if she stops taking drugs but despite this, Chloe still refuses to change. David then explains the reason while he's here: his friend Phil Becker had died during their last mission in the army, and he did not want Chloe to suffer the same pain that he had when he lost his friend and hands her a photo of him and Phil. Chloe can choose whether to take the picture or reject it, which will earn David's trust or anger. She then leaves for the junkyard taking her father's toolbox and an old repair manual with her. At the junkyard, Chloe fixes the old truck (requiring repairs on four parts of the engine) and uses a spark plug from the car that was formerly owned by William to finish the repairs. After taking the truck for a test drive, she continues to wait for Frank. Rachel shows up, as does Frank - but he isn't alone. Damon Merrick is here too and demands to know why Chloe is trying to find Sera. Through a conversation, Damon reveals that he knows Sera's whereabouts and learns that Rachel is James Amber's daughter. An altercation takes place (in which Chloe can give Damon the money she took from Drew and Mikey's room if she kept it) and Rachel attacks Damon with a wooden board and is then stabbed in the arm, shocking Chloe and Frank. Frank then hold back Damon while Chloe rushes Rachel to the hospital. Once there, two nurses quickly take her to surgery while Chloe stays in the waiting room. James and Amber later show up and when James asks Chloe what happened, she tearfully tells James the whole story. Chloe can then use this time to talk to Rose, Anthony North (Drew and Mikey's father), the couple from Episode 1, Steph, Drew, and Mikey (with the option of playing one last tabletop game with them). Rachel survives but still wants to find her mother. After James leaves them to talk, she convinces Chloe to break into her dad's office and gives her a code to disarm the alarm. Before leaving, she briefly speaks to Eliot Hampden. She can also eavesdrop on a conversation (or argument) that Samantha's mother is having with either Nathan or Sean in one of the rooms regarding Samantha's injury (presumed to be Nathan's doing). While at James's office, she finds a key hidden in a trophy and uses it to unlock a drawer, which contains evidence showing that James lied about a lot of things and that Damon has Sera. She contacts Damon using James's phone (who, in return, thinks she is James) and has her do some favors: destroy the evidence (which is a glove that Chloe must burn using her lighter and a trash can), finding the snitch (which has to be anyone other than Frank) and showing him the money he promised to give him (which is hidden behind some books on the bookshelf). After all this, he then reveals that Sera is held captive at the old mill. Before she can leave, she is caught by Eliot (who had followed Chloe from the hospital) and closes the door from behind, reactivating the alarm. An argument between the two begins, in which Eliot reveals that he strongly dislikes Rachel and wants Chloe all to himself, while Chloe backtalks against him while trying to call the police by pretending to agree with Eliot. If she wins the backtalk, the police will arrive and Chloe leaves while Eliot stays behind to confront the police. If she loses, Eliot will find out what she's up to, which will make Chloe set off the alarm, forcing Eliot to leave. After escaping, she drives to the old mill. After avoiding a logger truck, she stops near the burnt forest and will speak to an illusion of William, who convinces Chloe to keep going. After arriving at the old mill, she finds Frank's RV and heads into the mill. Optionally, she can find a knife in the mill to use as a weapon against Damon. Chloe confronts Damon, who has Sera tied up in a chair. He reveals that James is paying him to kill Sera and when Chloe tries to stop him, she gets knocked to the ground and is knocked unconscious by him. An injured Frank enters and struggles with Damon, presumably killing him afterwards as Frank got the better of him. Chloe wakes up and talks with Sera, who tries to convince her to not tell Rachel about anything that happened at the mill or her father's corruptive actions (while also believing that she can never be a good mother to Rachel and wishes for her to be with a father who loves her), knowing that it will cause more hurt to Rachel while Chloe tries to convince her to meet Rachel. After the conversation, Sera lets Chloe choose whether she should tell Rachel the truth or not. Chloe can also give Sera Rachel's bracelet if she has it, but she will give it back if Chloe didn't convince her. After Sera leaves, Chloe returns to the hospital and has to decide whether to lie to Rachel (which will cause her to make amends with James) or tell her everything (which will cause her to disown her father and sever ties with him for his wrongdoings). Regardless of her choice, she and Rachel remain friends at the end. The following scenes are then shown (which will all vary depending on Chloe's choices): 1. The Amber family either happily spending time with each other or in disarray. 2. Frank sitting by his RV holding a box of Damon's things. 3. Nathan and Samantha either spending time with each other or drifting apart (if Chloe wasn't supportive of them). 4. Chloe either embracing Joyce and David or still maintaining personal issues towards David. 5. Eliot, whose actions at the Amber house had led to him being expelled, preparing to leave Blackwell and will tear up a photograph of him and Chloe if she lost the backtalk. 6. Steph, Drew, and Mikey playing a tabletop game in front of Blackwell with one of the brothers still recovering from his injuries. The remaining scenes show Chloe and Rachel spending time together. While sitting near the lighthouse, Sera will show up if she was convinced by Chloe to meet Rachel. At the very end of the episode, in the final cinematic, the fate of Rachel Amber is suggested to be similar to that of Victoria and Max's from the first game, where Rachel's phone can be seen ringing inside the underground vault with Chloe being on the other line and the click of a camera can be heard in the background, implying that Rachel is photographed by either Nathan or Jefferson.

after all this , he then reveals that sera is held captive at the old mill .
before she can leave , she is caught by eliot ( who had followed chloe from the hospital ) and closes the door from behind , reactivating the alarm .
an argument between the two begins , in which eliot reveals that he strongly dislikes rachel and wants chloe all to himself , while chloe backtalks against him while trying to call the police by pretending to agree with eliot .
if she wins the backtalk , the police will arrive and chloe leaves while eliot stays behind to confront the police .

chloe wakes up and talks with sera , who tries to convince her to not tell rachel about anything that happened at the mill or her father 's corruptive actions ( while also believing that she can never be a good mother to rachel and wishes for her to be with a father who loves her ) , knowing that it will cause more hurt to rachel while chloe tries to convince her to meet rachel .
after the conversation , sera lets chloe choose whether she should tell rachel the truth or not .
chloe can also give sera rachel 's bracelet if she has it , but she will give it back if chloe did n't convince her .

We 're about to play a brand - new track from PissHead , and if you have n't heard these guys yet , what I want you to do is crank that stereo up as loud as it goes .","Continuing from the last episode where Chloe Price is at Rachel Amber 's house for dinner when Rachel accuses her father of cheating , James Amber reveals that the woman he was with in the park was Rachel 's real mother , Sera Gearhardt .
He then tells them the whole story , in which Chloe and Rachel then find themselves in a dark area with a viewfinder .
As James tells the story , they look through the viewfinder , which shows them visuals of how Sera and James met in high school and fell in love .
They had a child together ( Rachel ) but Sera became a drug addict .
Growing fearful of Sera 's behavior , James eventually left with the child and made an agreement with Sera to pay her monthly if she agreed to stay away .
This worked for 15 years .
Rachel is devastated and wants to meet Sera , but has no idea how to find her before heading upstairs .
Chloe agrees to help ( against James 's wishes ) and goes to Rachel 's room , where she finds Rachel laying in bed and is still upset with her father 's lies .
After using a flashlight from a toolbox and a star globe from a night light to form a starry night , Chloe is able to talk to Rachel , promising to help find Sera .
Chloe then has another dream where she is onstage in her Ariel costume on some seats that are arranged to look like car seats .
William is sitting in the front row of seats , acting like he is driving .
He explains the reason why people keep secrets : to keep their loved ones safe .
The dream ends with an actual truck appearing onstage and crushing William , causing Chloe to fall in depression while Victoria can be heard booing her .
The next morning , she returns home ( in which she may discover that David had searched through her room depending on decisions made in the previous episodes ) and calls Frank Bowers , who reluctantly agrees to meet Chloe at the junkyard .
While heading downstairs , she sees Joyce and David embracing each other .
When she tries to sneak pass them , they see her .
David reveals that he has decided to trust Chloe more if she stops taking drugs but despite this , Chloe still refuses to change .
David then explains the reason while he 's here : his friend Phil Becker had died during their last mission in the army , and he did not want Chloe to suffer the same pain that he had when he lost his friend and hands her a photo of him and Phil .
Chloe can choose whether to take the picture or reject it , which will earn David 's trust or anger .
She then leaves for the junkyard taking her father 's toolbox and an old repair manual with her .
At the junkyard , Chloe fixes the old truck ( requiring repairs on four parts of the engine ) and uses a spark plug from the car that was formerly owned by William to finish the repairs .
After taking the truck for a test drive , she continues to wait for Frank .
Rachel shows up , as does Frank - but he is n't alone .
Damon Merrick is here too and demands to know why Chloe is trying to find Sera .
Through a conversation , Damon reveals that he knows Sera 's whereabouts and learns that Rachel is James Amber 's daughter .
An altercation takes place ( in which Chloe can give Damon the money she took from Drew and Mikey 's room if she kept it ) and Rachel attacks Damon with a wooden board and is then stabbed in the arm , shocking Chloe and Frank .
Frank then hold back Damon while Chloe rushes Rachel to the hospital .
Once there , two nurses quickly take her to surgery while Chloe stays in the waiting room .
James and Amber later show up and when James asks Chloe what happened , she tearfully tells James the whole story .
Chloe can then use this time to talk to Rose , Anthony North ( Drew and Mikey 's father ) , the couple from Episode 1 , Steph , Drew , and Mikey ( with the option of playing one last tabletop game with them ) .
Rachel survives but still wants to find her mother .
After James leaves them to talk , she convinces Chloe to break into her dad 's office and gives her a code to disarm the alarm .
Before leaving , she briefly speaks to Eliot Hampden .
She can also eavesdrop on a conversation ( or argument ) that Samantha 's mother is having with either Nathan or Sean in one of the rooms regarding Samantha 's injury ( presumed to be Nathan 's doing ) .
While at James 's office , she finds a key hidden in a trophy and uses it to unlock a drawer , which contains evidence showing that James lied about a lot of things and that Damon has Sera .
She contacts Damon using James 's phone ( who , in return , thinks she is James ) and has her do some favors : destroy the evidence ( which is a glove that Chloe must burn using her lighter and a trash can ) , finding the snitch ( which has to be anyone other than Frank ) and showing him the money he promised to give him ( which is hidden behind some books on the bookshelf ) .

Both Rachel and Chloe are questioned about their absence the day before. The conversation varies depending on how Chloe treated Joyce, if she sabotaged Victoria's homework, if she went onstage and smoked weed, whether she helped Nathan or not, and if she won or lost the backtalk against Drew (if she helped Nathan). Rachel claims their misbehavior was her idea, and as punishment, is removed as Wells' administrative assistant and her role as Prospera in The Tempest. If Chloe goes along with Rachel, she will be suspended. If Chloe takes the blame for Rachel, she will be expelled, but Rachel won't be removed from the play. After they leave the office, Skip Matthews escorts Chloe to her locker, so she can clean it out. Chloe searches for her hidden joint but discovers Justin Williams has taken it. Angry, Chloe lies to Skip that she has to use the bathroom. Meanwhile, Joyce speaks with Rachel's parents, James, and Rose Amber. Once inside, she proceeds to tag it from ceiling to floor, venting her frustration. She then exits and Victoria approaches the bathroom, looking dumbfounded as she opens the door. Chloe enters the parking lot of Blackwell Academy. She can optionally talk to Eliot, who will feel sympathy for her expulsion or suspension and offer her a hug. He will again ask her if she wants to go to the play with him. Chloe walks to the car where Joyce and David are waiting for her; David asks her to empty her pockets on the hood of the car. David later announces that he will be moving in with them. This outrages Chloe and she storms off. David stops Joyce from going after her, wanting to give her some time to get over her anger. Chloe goes to the junkyard and knocks over items with her bat until she notices a very old truck. She scours the junkyard for various items needed to fix the truck: a battery from an impounded truck (which requires having to press a button to unlock the hood); something to cover the hole in the floor: a rug, a welcome mat, or a golf mat; a new light bulb from either a fish tank, a toy robot, or a Christmas wreath; and something to cover the torn seat: a pirate flag or a beach towel. She can also optionally decorate the truck using an Elvis Presley bobblehead found in a small box somewhere in the junkyard and draw a decoration on the back of the seat. Despite all her hard work, the truck still remains inoperational. She then relaxes in the driver's seat and smokes a cigarette. Chloe finds herself in another one of her dreams. She finds William, her deceased father, roasting marshmallows in the burning wreckage of his car. She sits next to him and roasts marshmallows too, as he warns her about the danger of fire, a metaphor for Rachel Amber. The dream ends with William's face being shown half-burnt with a raven pecking at his face. Chloe wakes up to find Rachel tapping on the window of her car, carrying a duffel bag. Rachel gets inside the car and the two have a ""therapy session"" (which will vary depending on if Rachel was removed from the play or not): they discuss their feelings about the current events in their life and how unhappy they are with them. Rachel leaves and gives Chloe her duffel bag, which is full of clothes. Chloe receives a call from Frank Bowers, who wants to meet up with her. Chloe enters the Hideout in the junkyard. She can optionally spruce up the place and then changes into one of Rachel's outfits. Frank approaches in his RV. Chloe sees a woman leaving the vehicle. She enters Frank's RV and he drives away. He asks her to retrieve his account book. Chloe opens the door to his bedroom, and Pompidou runs out. She takes his account book and brings it to him. Chloe then asks Frank about the woman, but he refuses to say anything. Frank reveals that Drew North runs Oxy for Damon Merrick and he owes him $1,000. He asks her to go to the school to find the money and bring it to him. After Frank drops off Chloe, she can speak with Steph Gingrich, Evan Harris, and Samuel Taylor. She shoos away a bird that Evan is photographing to distract him long enough for Chloe to damage a nearby sprinkler. This gets Samuel's attention and while he goes to fix the sprinkler, Chloe takes his keys and uses it to unlock the dorm, but encounters Skip. An argument begins, which will earn either Skip's trust or anger before he leaves to deal with an unauthorized vehicle in the parking lot (presumably Frank's RV). After she enters Drew and Mikey's room, she must figure out the combination to a locked trunk containing the money. If she fails too many times, she will get help from Steph. After getting the money, she is caught by Mikey and Drew (who are preparing to leave), followed by the arrival of Damon. Drew goes out to talk to him while telling Chloe not to leave the room. Upon hearing Damon beat up Drew, Chloe must choose whether to intervene or stay in the room, which will lead Drew to be glad for staying out of the way or upset for interfering. If she stays out of the fight, Drew will get injured and after Damon leaves, Chloe must choose to give the money to Drew or keep it. If she intervenes, Mikey will get hurt instead and Chloe will hand the money over to Damon, who then leaves. It is now late afternoon and Blackwell begins to start the play. Chloe can find Samantha Myers overhearing Nathan Prescott talking with his father, who wants his son to get over his fear and not humiliate him. Chloe can choose whether to talk to him or keep quiet. She can then convince Samantha to cheer for Nathan and can also encourage Nathan, be sarcastic towards him, or do nothing. Afterwards, she can talk to Hayden Jones, Dana Ward, and Travis Keaton and has the option of playing with the spotlights. In the changing room, Chloe will face a situation between Rachel and Victoria which varies depending on if Rachel was dropped from the play or not. If Rachel was removed from the play, this will lead to either Chloe getting Victoria to drop from the play via backtalk or Rachel drugging Victoria's tea if Chloe was nice to Victoria or lost the backtalk. If Rachel wasn't removed, Victoria will drug Rachel's tea instead. Chloe can either warn Rachel or distract Victoria. If she warns Rachel, she will get Victoria to drink the drugged tea by pretending to believe her. If Chloe distracts Victoria, she will temporally leave and Chloe will switch the cups, leading Victoria to drink the drugged tea upon returning. Keaton later informs the students that Juliet Watson, who was meant to play as Ariel, is delayed by the wildfire that Rachel caused and can't make it in time. Following this, Victoria will then either drop from the play (in which Rachel will then volunteer to take over for Victoria) or fall unconscious. Rachel then convinces a reluctant Chloe to take over for Juliet. As Chloe and Rachel perform onstage as Prospera and Ariel, Nathan then comes in, who will either leave in embarrassment or have confidence and play out his role. Juliet later arrives and replaces Chloe's spot in the play. At the end of the play, Rachel, Hayden, Dana, Juliet, Keaton, and Nathan all come out and bow to the audience, with Rachel bringing Chloe out to join the other performers. The mysterious woman from earlier is seen watching them from a distance. Rachel and Chloe are next seen wandering down a street together. Rachel is happy about the play and how Chloe took part in it. The two then discuss their plan to leave Arcadia Bay, in which Chloe can either receive Rachel's bracelet, a promise for a tattoo, or a kiss. After the conversation, they then head to Rachel's house to pick up clothes. Rachel and Chloe attempt to sneak upstairs but are caught by James. When James compliments her performance, her mood changes, and she despondently replies ""thanks"". Rachel heads upstairs to freshen up, leaving Chloe with her parents. Chloe then helps Rose set up plates and cups for the dinner table, question James of what he wants to drink (in which he will ask for Sherry), and light the candles on the table with her lighter. The four all sit down for dinner and Rachel's parents begin talking about the forest fire and the reports that it was arson. The conversation soon turns into an argument when Rachel's anger visibly increases throughout James's lecture. Chloe can either calm Rachel down or attack James on his misdeeds with her backtalk. Whichever option is chosen, Rachel will lose her temper and call James out. When Chloe and Rose join in the argument, Rachel begins to dissociate and eventually throws a salad bowl through the table, smashing it. She screams at James to tell her the truth. James tells her that the woman he kissed was not his mistress, but is in fact, Rachel's biological mother. The episode ends with scenes showing Steph at the hospital to see Drew and Mikey, Joyce embracing David in despair upon seeing that Chloe hasn't returned, Rachel's biological mother smoking a cigarette, Damon approaching Frank (how they will react depends on whether Chloe gave the money to Damon, Drew, or kept it), Victoria looking at a Tempest poster the dressing room before stepping on it and leaving, Samantha approaching Nathan, and the wildfire still happening in the distance.

She scours the junkyard for various items needed to fix the truck : a battery from an impounded truck ( which requires having to press a button to unlock the hood ) ; something to cover the hole in the floor : a rug , a welcome mat , or a golf mat ; a new light bulb from either a fish tank , a toy robot , or a Christmas wreath ; and something to cover the torn seat : a pirate flag or a beach towel .
She can also optionally decorate the truck using an Elvis Presley bobblehead found in a small box somewhere in the junkyard and draw a decoration on the back of the seat .
Despite all her hard work , the truck still remains inoperational .
She then relaxes in the driver 's seat and smokes a cigarette .
Chloe finds herself in another one of her dreams .
She finds William , her deceased father , roasting marshmallows in the burning wreckage of his car .
She sits next to him and roasts marshmallows too , as he warns her about the danger of fire , a metaphor for Rachel Amber .
The dream ends with William 's face being shown half - burnt with a raven pecking at his face .
Chloe wakes up to find Rachel tapping on the window of her car , carrying a duffel bag .
Rachel gets inside the car and the two have a "" therapy session "" ( which will vary depending on if Rachel was removed from the play or not ): they discuss their feelings about the current events in their life and how unhappy they are with them .
Rachel leaves and gives Chloe her duffel bag , which is full of clothes .
Chloe receives a call from Frank Bowers , who wants to meet up with her .

Frank reveals that Drew North runs Oxy for Damon Merrick and he owes him $ 1,000 .
He asks her to go to the school to find the money and bring it to him .
After Frank drops off Chloe , she can speak with Steph Gingrich , Evan Harris , and Samuel Taylor .
She shoos away a bird that Evan is photographing to distract him long enough for Chloe to damage a nearby sprinkler .
This gets Samuel 's attention and while he goes to fix the sprinkler , Chloe takes his keys and uses it to unlock the dorm , but encounters Skip .
An argument begins , which will earn either Skip 's trust or anger before he leaves to deal with an unauthorized vehicle in the parking lot ( presumably Frank 's RV ) .
After she enters Drew and Mikey 's room , she must figure out the combination to a locked trunk containing the money .
If she fails too many times , she will get help from Steph .
After getting the money , she is caught by Mikey and Drew ( who are preparing to leave ) , followed by the arrival of Damon .
Drew goes out to talk to him while telling Chloe not to leave the room .
Upon hearing Damon beat up Drew , Chloe must choose whether to intervene or stay in the room , which will lead Drew to be glad for staying out of the way or upset for interfering .
If she stays out of the fight , Drew will get injured and after Damon leaves , Chloe must choose to give the money to Drew or keep it .
If she intervenes , Mikey will get hurt instead and Chloe will hand the money over to Damon , who then leaves .
It is now late afternoon and Blackwell begins to start the play .
Chloe can find Samantha Myers overhearing Nathan Prescott talking with his father , who wants his son to get over his fear and not humiliate him .
Chloe can choose whether to talk to him or keep quiet .
She can then convince Samantha to cheer for Nathan and can also encourage Nathan , be sarcastic towards him , or do nothing .
Afterwards , she can talk to Hayden Jones , Dana Ward , and Travis Keaton and has the option of playing with the spotlights .
In the changing room , Chloe will face a situation between Rachel and Victoria which varies depending on if Rachel was dropped from the play or not .
If Rachel was removed from the play , this will lead to either Chloe getting Victoria to drop from the play via backtalk or Rachel drugging Victoria 's tea if Chloe was nice to Victoria or lost the backtalk .
If Rachel was n't removed , Victoria will drug Rachel 's tea instead .
Chloe can either warn Rachel or distract Victoria .
If she warns Rachel , she will get Victoria to drink the drugged tea by pretending to believe her .
If Chloe distracts Victoria , she will temporally leave and Chloe will switch the cups , leading Victoria to drink the drugged tea upon returning .
Keaton later informs the students that Juliet Watson , who was meant to play as Ariel , is delayed by the wildfire that Rachel caused and ca n't make it in time .
Following this , Victoria will then either drop from the play ( in which Rachel will then volunteer to take over for Victoria ) or fall unconscious .
Rachel then convinces a reluctant Chloe to take over for Juliet .
As Chloe and Rachel perform onstage as Prospera and Ariel , Nathan then comes in , who will either leave in embarrassment or have confidence and play out his role .
Juliet later arrives and replaces Chloe 's spot in the play .
At the end of the play , Rachel , Hayden , Dana , Juliet , Keaton , and Nathan all come out and bow to the audience , with Rachel bringing Chloe out to join the other performers .

Rachel and Chloe attempt to sneak upstairs but are caught by James .
When James compliments her performance , her mood changes , and she despondently replies "" thanks "" .
Rachel heads upstairs to freshen up , leaving Chloe with her parents .
Chloe then helps Rose set up plates and cups for the dinner table , question James of what he wants to drink ( in which he will ask for Sherry ) , and light the candles on the table with her lighter .
The four all sit down for dinner and Rachel 's parents begin talking about the forest fire and the reports that it was arson .
The conversation soon turns into an argument when Rachel 's anger visibly increases throughout James 's lecture .
Chloe can either calm Rachel down or attack James on his misdeeds with her backtalk .
Whichever option is chosen , Rachel will lose her temper and call James out .
When Chloe and Rose join in the argument , Rachel begins to dissociate and eventually throws a salad bowl through the table , smashing it .
She screams at James to tell her the truth .

[EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Rachel looks awesome...","The episode starts with a hooded Chloe Price smoking a cigarette and standing at the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to come. After its passage, she takes off her hood and goes towards the old mill, ignoring the ""No Trespassing"" sign after jumping over a fence. In order to get inside the mill, she starts an argument with the bouncer, in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails. After entering, she can interact with people, objects, graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money (or not). If she steals the money, she'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later. After this, she'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys, the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her. However, she'll manage to see the band by going upstairs, even with the floor there being rotten. She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her. She's saved by Rachel Amber, in her very first appearance, and will have the first major choice of the game: attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing. After running downstairs, the two girls stop and look at Frank, who notices what's going to happen and quickly stops the guys, causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill. Rachel pulls Chloe along with her, and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night. The next morning, Chloe is shown waking up in her room, at the Price household. She sits up and takes her red 'Oregon' ashtray and starts smoking a cigarette (or weed, if she bought it from Frank earlier with the stolen money). Chloe can look at a photo of her and Max Caulfield as kids along with her dad, William Price and can also look at her diary. After being called by her mother, Joyce Price, for breakfast downstairs, she'll get up from her bed and will be able to interact with many objects around her room. She'll change clothes before leaving her room (the player gets to choose her outfit). Due to having drunk too much, Chloe notices her phone is missing. She then goes to her mother's room to call her phone with her mother's phone. There, she can interact with another object before using her mother's phone. By doing this, Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom, and just after she takes it, her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone, causing her to go back to the room. When she finally goes downstairs, she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on. She'll then talk with her mother about several topics, and at the end of the conversation, she'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels. Depending on her choice, Joyce will be either kind or tough towards her. Chloe'll have to pick the keys from her stepfather, David Madsen, and take them to him since he'll be taking her to school today. After leaving the house and going to David, he'll ask her to get the tools he needs to fix his car in the garage. After this, she gets in the car and David will try to start a conversation with her. She can either start a fight with him or listen to what he has to say. After the talk, Chloe will fall asleep and have a weird dream about being in a car with her dad, going to pick up her mom from the grocery store. The dream abruptly ends with a truck crashing through William's car. When she wakes up, she's already at Blackwell Academy. There, she can talk to Eliot Hampden (and choose whether or not she wants to watch The Tempest play with him), Victoria Chase (with the option of sabotaging her homework if doing so), Skip Matthews (with the option of listening to the demo of his band, PissHead, and giving him your opinion on it if doing so), Principal Wells (only if she sits on a crate on the stage and with the option of starting a backtalk challenge with him if doing so), Michelle Grant, Mikey North and Steph Gingrich (in order to get her DVD and with the additional option of playing a tabletop game with them), and other students. Afterwards, she'll go towards the school entrance, but she'll be interrupted by Drew North and Nathan Prescott, who are starting a fight. A student called Samantha Myers urges Chloe to do something to help Nathan, and Chloe can either backtalk Drew and defend Nathan or just ignore them, which will cause Samantha to either thank Chloe or be upset with her for not helping. When the fight is over, she can finally enter the school, and just as she opens the door, Rachel appears on the other side and pulls her along with her to the Drama Lab where Travis Keaton is rehearsing with Dana Ward and Hayden Jones. Rachel will ask for her opinion on Miranda's love for Fernando, both portrayed by Dana and Hayden respectively in ""The Tempest"" play, and Chloe can choose whether to say it's true love or not. After the class is over, everyone will leave the room, except for Chloe and Rachel. Rachel will change to normal clothes and ask Chloe to get her belt from her bag and bring it to her. After doing this, they'll have a short conversation before Rachel invites Chloe to skip school, and they end up in a train carriage where, after finding some crates to sit on, they play the game Two Truths and a Lie. Chloe can either cheat or follow the game rules. After their game, Chloe will have the option of sharing or not her earbuds with Rachel during their trip. Upon arriving at Overlook Park, they'll play another game using the viewfinders to spy on people around the park. However, the viewfinder that they intend to use it broken. Chloe asks Rachel for something sharp like a knife and she gives her a nail file, which Chloe uses to unscrew a deducation plate from a park bench and then uses it to break open the viewfinder, allowing them to use it for free.

Rachel approaches the couple and starts acting sick, throwing herself to the ground and pretending to be in need of resuscitation. Chloe can encourage the man to help her, either succeeding or failing on doing so resulting in the man ""saving"" Rachel's life or the woman seeing through their ploy. Whatever the outcome is, the two girls will get the wine. After this, they're shown walking on the train tracks. Chloe invites Rachel to explore a junkyard nearby and Rachel lets her explore on her own.

Both Rachel and Chloe are questioned about their absence the day before. The conversation varies depending on how Chloe treated Joyce, if she sabotaged Victoria's homework, if she went onstage and smoked weed, whether she helped Nathan or not, and if she won or lost the backtalk against Drew (if she helped Nathan). Rachel claims their misbehavior was her idea, and as punishment, is removed as Wells' administrative assistant and her role as Prospera in The Tempest. If Chloe goes along with Rachel, she will be suspended. If Chloe takes the blame for Rachel, she will be expelled, but Rachel won't be removed from the play. After they leave the office, Skip Matthews escorts Chloe to her locker, so she can clean it out. Chloe searches for her hidden joint but discovers Justin Williams has taken it. Angry, Chloe lies to Skip that she has to use the bathroom. Meanwhile, Joyce speaks with Rachel's parents, James, and Rose Amber. Once inside, she proceeds to tag it from ceiling to floor, venting her frustration. She then exits and Victoria approaches the bathroom, looking dumbfounded as she opens the door. Chloe enters the parking lot of Blackwell Academy. She can optionally talk to Eliot, who will feel sympathy for her expulsion or suspension and offer her a hug. He will again ask her if she wants to go to the play with him. Chloe walks to the car where Joyce and David are waiting for her; David asks her to empty her pockets on the hood of the car. David later announces that he will be moving in with them. This outrages Chloe and she storms off. David stops Joyce from going after her, wanting to give her some time to get over her anger. Chloe goes to the junkyard and knocks over items with her bat until she notices a very old truck. She scours the junkyard for various items needed to fix the truck: a battery from an impounded truck (which requires having to press a button to unlock the hood); something to cover the hole in the floor: a rug, a welcome mat, or a golf mat; a new light bulb from either a fish tank, a toy robot, or a Christmas wreath; and something to cover the torn seat: a pirate flag or a beach towel. She can also optionally decorate the truck using an Elvis Presley bobblehead found in a small box somewhere in the junkyard and draw a decoration on the back of the seat. Despite all her hard work, the truck still remains inoperational. She then relaxes in the driver's seat and smokes a cigarette. Chloe finds herself in another one of her dreams. She finds William, her deceased father, roasting marshmallows in the burning wreckage of his car. She sits next to him and roasts marshmallows too, as he warns her about the danger of fire, a metaphor for Rachel Amber. The dream ends with William's face being shown half-burnt with a raven pecking at his face. Chloe wakes up to find Rachel tapping on the window of her car, carrying a duffel bag. Rachel gets inside the car and the two have a ""therapy session"" (which will vary depending on if Rachel was removed from the play or not): they discuss their feelings about the current events in their life and how unhappy they are with them. Rachel leaves and gives Chloe her duffel bag, which is full of clothes. Chloe receives a call from Frank Bowers, who wants to meet up with her. Chloe enters the Hideout in the junkyard. She can optionally spruce up the place and then changes into one of Rachel's outfits. Frank approaches in his RV. Chloe sees a woman leaving the vehicle. She enters Frank's RV and he drives away. He asks her to retrieve his account book. Chloe opens the door to his bedroom, and Pompidou runs out. She takes his account book and brings it to him. Chloe then asks Frank about the woman, but he refuses to say anything. Frank reveals that Drew North runs Oxy for Damon Merrick and he owes him $1,000. He asks her to go to the school to find the money and bring it to him. After Frank drops off Chloe, she can speak with Steph Gingrich, Evan Harris, and Samuel Taylor. She shoos away a bird that Evan is photographing to distract him long enough for Chloe to damage a nearby sprinkler. This gets Samuel's attention and while he goes to fix the sprinkler, Chloe takes his keys and uses it to unlock the dorm, but encounters Skip. An argument begins, which will earn either Skip's trust or anger before he leaves to deal with an unauthorized vehicle in the parking lot (presumably Frank's RV). After she enters Drew and Mikey's room, she must figure out the combination to a locked trunk containing the money. If she fails too many times, she will get help from Steph. After getting the money, she is caught by Mikey and Drew (who are preparing to leave), followed by the arrival of Damon. Drew goes out to talk to him while telling Chloe not to leave the room. Upon hearing Damon beat up Drew, Chloe must choose whether to intervene or stay in the room, which will lead Drew to be glad for staying out of the way or upset for interfering. If she stays out of the fight, Drew will get injured and after Damon leaves, Chloe must choose to give the money to Drew or keep it. If she intervenes, Mikey will get hurt instead and Chloe will hand the money over to Damon, who then leaves. It is now late afternoon and Blackwell begins to start the play. Chloe can find Samantha Myers overhearing Nathan Prescott talking with his father, who wants his son to get over his fear and not humiliate him. Chloe can choose whether to talk to him or keep quiet. She can then convince Samantha to cheer for Nathan and can also encourage Nathan, be sarcastic towards him, or do nothing. Afterwards, she can talk to Hayden Jones, Dana Ward, and Travis Keaton and has the option of playing with the spotlights. In the changing room, Chloe will face a situation between Rachel and Victoria which varies depending on if Rachel was dropped from the play or not. If Rachel was removed from the play, this will lead to either Chloe getting Victoria to drop from the play via backtalk or Rachel drugging Victoria's tea if Chloe was nice to Victoria or lost the backtalk. If Rachel wasn't removed, Victoria will drug Rachel's tea instead. Chloe can either warn Rachel or distract Victoria. If she warns Rachel, she will get Victoria to drink the drugged tea by pretending to believe her. If Chloe distracts Victoria, she will temporally leave and Chloe will switch the cups, leading Victoria to drink the drugged tea upon returning. Keaton later informs the students that Juliet Watson, who was meant to play as Ariel, is delayed by the wildfire that Rachel caused and can't make it in time. Following this, Victoria will then either drop from the play (in which Rachel will then volunteer to take over for Victoria) or fall unconscious. Rachel then convinces a reluctant Chloe to take over for Juliet. As Chloe and Rachel perform onstage as Prospera and Ariel, Nathan then comes in, who will either leave in embarrassment or have confidence and play out his role. Juliet later arrives and replaces Chloe's spot in the play. At the end of the play, Rachel, Hayden, Dana, Juliet, Keaton, and Nathan all come out and bow to the audience, with Rachel bringing Chloe out to join the other performers. The mysterious woman from earlier is seen watching them from a distance. Rachel and Chloe are next seen wandering down a street together. Rachel is happy about the play and how Chloe took part in it. The two then discuss their plan to leave Arcadia Bay, in which Chloe can either receive Rachel's bracelet, a promise for a tattoo, or a kiss. After the conversation, they then head to Rachel's house to pick up clothes. Rachel and Chloe attempt to sneak upstairs but are caught by James. When James compliments her performance, her mood changes, and she despondently replies ""thanks"". Rachel heads upstairs to freshen up, leaving Chloe with her parents. Chloe then helps Rose set up plates and cups for the dinner table, question James of what he wants to drink (in which he will ask for Sherry), and light the candles on the table with her lighter. The four all sit down for dinner and Rachel's parents begin talking about the forest fire and the reports that it was arson. The conversation soon turns into an argument when Rachel's anger visibly increases throughout James's lecture. Chloe can either calm Rachel down or attack James on his misdeeds with her backtalk. Whichever option is chosen, Rachel will lose her temper and call James out. When Chloe and Rose join in the argument, Rachel begins to dissociate and eventually throws a salad bowl through the table, smashing it. She screams at James to tell her the truth. James tells her that the woman he kissed was not his mistress, but is in fact, Rachel's biological mother. The episode ends with scenes showing Steph at the hospital to see Drew and Mikey, Joyce embracing David in despair upon seeing that Chloe hasn't returned, Rachel's biological mother smoking a cigarette, Damon approaching Frank (how they will react depends on whether Chloe gave the money to Damon, Drew, or kept it), Victoria looking at a Tempest poster the dressing room before stepping on it and leaving, Samantha approaching Nathan, and the wildfire still happening in the distance.

The mysterious woman from earlier is seen watching them from a distance. Rachel and Chloe are next seen wandering down a street together. Rachel is happy about the play and how Chloe took part in it. The two then discuss their plan to leave Arcadia Bay, in which Chloe can either receive Rachel's bracelet, a promise for a tattoo, or a kiss. After the conversation, they then head to Rachel's house to pick up clothes. Rachel and Chloe attempt to sneak upstairs but are caught by James. When James compliments her performance, her mood changes, and she despondently replies ""thanks"". Rachel heads upstairs to freshen up, leaving Chloe with her parents.

The four all sit down for dinner and Rachel's parents begin talking about the forest fire and the reports that it was arson. The conversation soon turns into an argument when Rachel's anger visibly increases throughout James's lecture. Chloe can either calm Rachel down or attack James on his misdeeds with her backtalk. Whichever option is chosen, Rachel will lose her temper and call James out. When Chloe and Rose join in the argument, Rachel begins to dissociate and eventually throws a salad bowl through the table, smashing it. She screams at James to tell her the truth. James tells her that the woman he kissed was not his mistress, but is in fact, Rachel's biological mother. The episode ends with scenes showing Steph at the hospital to see Drew and Mikey, Joyce embracing David in despair upon seeing that Chloe hasn't returned, Rachel's biological mother smoking a cigarette, Damon approaching Frank (how they will react depends on whether Chloe gave the money to Damon, Drew, or kept it), Victoria looking at a Tempest poster the dressing room before stepping on it and leaving, Samantha approaching Nathan, and the wildfire still happening in the distance.

[EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Rachel looks awesome...","The episode starts with a hooded Chloe Price smoking a cigarette and standing at the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to come. After its passage, she takes off her hood and goes towards the old mill, ignoring the ""No Trespassing"" sign after jumping over a fence. In order to get inside the mill, she starts an argument with the bouncer, in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails. After entering, she can interact with people, objects, graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money (or not). If she steals the money, she'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later. After this, she'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys, the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her. However, she'll manage to see the band by going upstairs, even with the floor there being rotten. She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her. She's saved by Rachel Amber, in her very first appearance, and will have the first major choice of the game: attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing. After running downstairs, the two girls stop and look at Frank, who notices what's going to happen and quickly stops the guys, causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill. Rachel pulls Chloe along with her, and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night. The next morning, Chloe is shown waking up in her room, at the Price household. She sits up and takes her red 'Oregon' ashtray and starts smoking a cigarette (or weed, if she bought it from Frank earlier with the stolen money). Chloe can look at a photo of her and Max Caulfield as kids along with her dad, William Price and can also look at her diary. After being called by her mother, Joyce Price, for breakfast downstairs, she'll get up from her bed and will be able to interact with many objects around her room. She'll change clothes before leaving her room (the player gets to choose her outfit). Due to having drunk too much, Chloe notices her phone is missing. She then goes to her mother's room to call her phone with her mother's phone. There, she can interact with another object before using her mother's phone. By doing this, Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom, and just after she takes it, her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone, causing her to go back to the room. When she finally goes downstairs, she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on. She'll then talk with her mother about several topics, and at the end of the conversation, she'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels. Depending on her choice, Joyce will be either kind or tough towards her. Chloe'll have to pick the keys from her stepfather, David Madsen, and take them to him since he'll be taking her to school today. After leaving the house and going to David, he'll ask her to get the tools he needs to fix his car in the garage. After this, she gets in the car and David will try to start a conversation with her. She can either start a fight with him or listen to what he has to say. After the talk, Chloe will fall asleep and have a weird dream about being in a car with her dad, going to pick up her mom from the grocery store. The dream abruptly ends with a truck crashing through William's car. When she wakes up, she's already at Blackwell Academy. There, she can talk to Eliot Hampden (and choose whether or not she wants to watch The Tempest play with him), Victoria Chase (with the option of sabotaging her homework if doing so), Skip Matthews (with the option of listening to the demo of his band, PissHead, and giving him your opinion on it if doing so), Principal Wells (only if she sits on a crate on the stage and with the option of starting a backtalk challenge with him if doing so), Michelle Grant, Mikey North and Steph Gingrich (in order to get her DVD and with the additional option of playing a tabletop game with them), and other students. Afterwards, she'll go towards the school entrance, but she'll be interrupted by Drew North and Nathan Prescott, who are starting a fight. A student called Samantha Myers urges Chloe to do something to help Nathan, and Chloe can either backtalk Drew and defend Nathan or just ignore them, which will cause Samantha to either thank Chloe or be upset with her for not helping. When the fight is over, she can finally enter the school, and just as she opens the door, Rachel appears on the other side and pulls her along with her to the Drama Lab where Travis Keaton is rehearsing with Dana Ward and Hayden Jones. Rachel will ask for her opinion on Miranda's love for Fernando, both portrayed by Dana and Hayden respectively in ""The Tempest"" play, and Chloe can choose whether to say it's true love or not. After the class is over, everyone will leave the room, except for Chloe and Rachel. Rachel will change to normal clothes and ask Chloe to get her belt from her bag and bring it to her. After doing this, they'll have a short conversation before Rachel invites Chloe to skip school, and they end up in a train carriage where, after finding some crates to sit on, they play the game Two Truths and a Lie. Chloe can either cheat or follow the game rules. After their game, Chloe will have the option of sharing or not her earbuds with Rachel during their trip. Upon arriving at Overlook Park, they'll play another game using the viewfinders to spy on people around the park. However, the viewfinder that they intend to use it broken. Chloe asks Rachel for something sharp like a knife and she gives her a nail file, which Chloe uses to unscrew a deducation plate from a park bench and then uses it to break open the viewfinder, allowing them to use it for free. When they get a closer view of the last couple available, a man and a woman under a tree, Rachel gets distressed when they start kissing and puts an end to their game, telling Chloe she needs to get drunk. They'll then go to the other side of the park, where a couple is having a picnic and have a bottle of wine on their table. Rachel approaches the couple and starts acting sick, throwing herself to the ground and pretending to be in need of resuscitation. Chloe can encourage the man to help her, either succeeding or failing on doing so resulting in the man ""saving"" Rachel's life or the woman seeing through their ploy. Whatever the outcome is, the two girls will get the wine. After this, they're shown walking on the train tracks. Chloe invites Rachel to explore a junkyard nearby and Rachel lets her explore on her own. After a long conversation between the two, no matter what choices the player has made so far, Rachel will leave, but not before Chloe tries to convince her to stay. Chloe has the option to say that they have a real friendship or something more. Once Rachel leaves, Chloe gets angry and breaks everything around her. She then has a meltdown upon seeing her late father's car. She'll fall asleep and have another dream about her father, this time, with him advising/warning her on her relationship with Rachel, in which Chloe will see Rachel outside of the car, who will then catch fire. When she wakes up, it's already night and she goes back to the overlook where she finds Rachel. Upon a brief dialogue, in which Rachel reveals the man they had seen at the park was her dad, and that he was cheating on her mother with that woman. Rachel takes out a photo of her as a kid with her father, asks Chloe for her lighter which she uses it burn the photo, throwing it into a nearby trash bin, and starting a wildfire by kicking the bin into a tree nearby.

[EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Rachel looks awesome...","The episode starts with a hooded Chloe Price smoking a cigarette and standing at the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to come. After its passage, she takes off her hood and goes towards the old mill, ignoring the ""No Trespassing"" sign after jumping over a fence. In order to get inside the mill, she starts an argument with the bouncer, in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails. After entering, she can interact with people, objects, graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money (or not). If she steals the money, she'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later. After this, she'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys, the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her. However, she'll manage to see the band by going upstairs, even with the floor there being rotten. She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her. She's saved by Rachel Amber, in her very first appearance, and will have the first major choice of the game: attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing. After running downstairs, the two girls stop and look at Frank, who notices what's going to happen and quickly stops the guys, causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill. Rachel pulls Chloe along with her, and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night. The next morning, Chloe is shown waking up in her room, at the Price household. She sits up and takes her red 'Oregon' ashtray and starts smoking a cigarette (or weed, if she bought it from Frank earlier with the stolen money). Chloe can look at a photo of her and Max Caulfield as kids along with her dad, William Price and can also look at her diary. After being called by her mother, Joyce Price, for breakfast downstairs, she'll get up from her bed and will be able to interact with many objects around her room. She'll change clothes before leaving her room (the player gets to choose her outfit). Due to having drunk too much, Chloe notices her phone is missing. She then goes to her mother's room to call her phone with her mother's phone. There, she can interact with another object before using her mother's phone. By doing this, Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom, and just after she takes it, her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone, causing her to go back to the room. When she finally goes downstairs, she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on. She'll then talk with her mother about several topics, and at the end of the conversation, she'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels. Depending on her choice, Joyce will be either kind or tough towards her. Chloe'll have to pick the keys from her stepfather, David Madsen, and take them to him since he'll be taking her to school today. After leaving the house and going to David, he'll ask her to get the tools he needs to fix his car in the garage. After this, she gets in the car and David will try to start a conversation with her. She can either start a fight with him or listen to what he has to say. After the talk, Chloe will fall asleep and have a weird dream about being in a car with her dad, going to pick up her mom from the grocery store. The dream abruptly ends with a truck crashing through William's car. When she wakes up, she's already at Blackwell Academy. There, she can talk to Eliot Hampden (and choose whether or not she wants to watch The Tempest play with him), Victoria Chase (with the option of sabotaging her homework if doing so), Skip Matthews (with the option of listening to the demo of his band, PissHead, and giving him your opinion on it if doing so), Principal Wells (only if she sits on a crate on the stage and with the option of starting a backtalk challenge with him if doing so), Michelle Grant, Mikey North and Steph Gingrich (in order to get her DVD and with the additional option of playing a tabletop game with them), and other students. Afterwards, she'll go towards the school entrance, but she'll be interrupted by Drew North and Nathan Prescott, who are starting a fight. A student called Samantha Myers urges Chloe to do something to help Nathan, and Chloe can either backtalk Drew and defend Nathan or just ignore them, which will cause Samantha to either thank Chloe or be upset with her for not helping. When the fight is over, she can finally enter the school, and just as she opens the door, Rachel appears on the other side and pulls her along with her to the Drama Lab where Travis Keaton is rehearsing with Dana Ward and Hayden Jones.

[EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Rachel would want to know more.","Episode 2: Brave New World begins with Rachel Amber and Chloe Price in Principal Wells' office. Both Rachel and Chloe are questioned about their absence the day before. The conversation varies depending on how Chloe treated Joyce, if she sabotaged Victoria's homework, if she went onstage and smoked weed, whether she helped Nathan or not, and if she won or lost the backtalk against Drew (if she helped Nathan). Rachel claims their misbehavior was her idea, and as punishment, is removed as Wells' administrative assistant and her role as Prospera in The Tempest. If Chloe goes along with Rachel, she will be suspended. If Chloe takes the blame for Rachel, she will be expelled, but Rachel won't be removed from the play. After they leave the office, Skip Matthews escorts Chloe to her locker, so she can clean it out. Chloe searches for her hidden joint but discovers Justin Williams has taken it. Angry, Chloe lies to Skip that she has to use the bathroom. Meanwhile, Joyce speaks with Rachel's parents, James, and Rose Amber. Once inside, she proceeds to tag it from ceiling to floor, venting her frustration. She then exits and Victoria approaches the bathroom, looking dumbfounded as she opens the door. Chloe enters the parking lot of Blackwell Academy. She can optionally talk to Eliot, who will feel sympathy for her expulsion or suspension and offer her a hug. He will again ask her if she wants to go to the play with him. Chloe walks to the car where Joyce and David are waiting for her; David asks her to empty her pockets on the hood of the car. David later announces that he will be moving in with them. This outrages Chloe and she storms off. David stops Joyce from going after her, wanting to give her some time to get over her anger. Chloe goes to the junkyard and knocks over items with her bat until she notices a very old truck. She scours the junkyard for various items needed to fix the truck: a battery from an impounded truck (which requires having to press a button to unlock the hood); something to cover the hole in the floor: a rug, a welcome mat, or a golf mat; a new light bulb from either a fish tank, a toy robot, or a Christmas wreath; and something to cover the torn seat: a pirate flag or a beach towel. She can also optionally decorate the truck using an Elvis Presley bobblehead found in a small box somewhere in the junkyard and draw a decoration on the back of the seat. Despite all her hard work, the truck still remains inoperational. She then relaxes in the driver's seat and smokes a cigarette. Chloe finds herself in another one of her dreams. She finds William, her deceased father, roasting marshmallows in the burning wreckage of his car. She sits next to him and roasts marshmallows too, as he warns her about the danger of fire, a metaphor for Rachel Amber. The dream ends with William's face being shown half-burnt with a raven pecking at his face. Chloe wakes up to find Rachel tapping on the window of her car, carrying a duffel bag. Rachel gets inside the car and the two have a ""therapy session"" (which will vary depending on if Rachel was removed from the play or not): they discuss their feelings about the current events in their life and how unhappy they are with them. Rachel leaves and gives Chloe her duffel bag, which is full of clothes. Chloe receives a call from Frank Bowers, who wants to meet up with her. Chloe enters the Hideout in the junkyard. She can optionally spruce up the place and then changes into one of Rachel's outfits. Frank approaches in his RV. Chloe sees a woman leaving the vehicle. She enters Frank's RV and he drives away. He asks her to retrieve his account book. Chloe opens the door to his bedroom, and Pompidou runs out. She takes his account book and brings it to him. Chloe then asks Frank about the woman, but he refuses to say anything. Frank reveals that Drew North runs Oxy for Damon Merrick and he owes him $1,000. He asks her to go to the school to find the money and bring it to him. After Frank drops off Chloe, she can speak with Steph Gingrich, Evan Harris, and Samuel Taylor. She shoos away a bird that Evan is photographing to distract him long enough for Chloe to damage a nearby sprinkler. This gets Samuel's attention and while he goes to fix the sprinkler, Chloe takes his keys and uses it to unlock the dorm, but encounters Skip. An argument begins, which will earn either Skip's trust or anger before he leaves to deal with an unauthorized vehicle in the parking lot (presumably Frank's RV). After she enters Drew and Mikey's room, she must figure out the combination to a locked trunk containing the money. If she fails too many times, she will get help from Steph. After getting the money, she is caught by Mikey and Drew (who are preparing to leave), followed by the arrival of Damon. Drew goes out to talk to him while telling Chloe not to leave the room. Upon hearing Damon beat up Drew, Chloe must choose whether to intervene or stay in the room, which will lead Drew to be glad for staying out of the way or upset for interfering. If she stays out of the fight, Drew will get injured and after Damon leaves, Chloe must choose to give the money to Drew or keep it. If she intervenes, Mikey will get hurt instead and Chloe will hand the money over to Damon, who then leaves. It is now late afternoon and Blackwell begins to start the play. Chloe can find Samantha Myers overhearing Nathan Prescott talking with his father, who wants his son to get over his fear and not humiliate him. Chloe can choose whether to talk to him or keep quiet. She can then convince Samantha to cheer for Nathan and can also encourage Nathan, be sarcastic towards him, or do nothing. Afterwards, she can talk to Hayden Jones, Dana Ward, and Travis Keaton and has the option of playing with the spotlights. In the changing room, Chloe will face a situation between Rachel and Victoria which varies depending on if Rachel was dropped from the play or not. If Rachel was removed from the play, this will lead to either Chloe getting Victoria to drop from the play via backtalk or Rachel drugging Victoria's tea if Chloe was nice to Victoria or lost the backtalk. If Rachel wasn't removed, Victoria will drug Rachel's tea instead. Chloe can either warn Rachel or distract Victoria. If she warns Rachel, she will get Victoria to drink the drugged tea by pretending to believe her. If Chloe distracts Victoria, she will temporally leave and Chloe will switch the cups, leading Victoria to drink the drugged tea upon returning. Keaton later informs the students that Juliet Watson, who was meant to play as Ariel, is delayed by the wildfire that Rachel caused and can't make it in time. Following this, Victoria will then either drop from the play (in which Rachel will then volunteer to take over for Victoria) or fall unconscious. Rachel then convinces a reluctant Chloe to take over for Juliet. As Chloe and Rachel perform onstage as Prospera and Ariel, Nathan then comes in, who will either leave in embarrassment or have confidence and play out his role. Juliet later arrives and replaces Chloe's spot in the play. At the end of the play, Rachel, Hayden, Dana, Juliet, Keaton, and Nathan all come out and bow to the audience, with Rachel bringing Chloe out to join the other performers. The mysterious woman from earlier is seen watching them from a distance. Rachel and Chloe are next seen wandering down a street together. Rachel is happy about the play and how Chloe took part in it. The two then discuss their plan to leave Arcadia Bay, in which Chloe can either receive Rachel's bracelet, a promise for a tattoo, or a kiss. After the conversation, they then head to Rachel's house to pick up clothes. Rachel and Chloe attempt to sneak upstairs but are caught by James. When James compliments her performance, her mood changes, and she despondently replies ""thanks"". Rachel heads upstairs to freshen up, leaving Chloe with her parents. Chloe then helps Rose set up plates and cups for the dinner table, question James of what he wants to drink (in which he will ask for Sherry), and light the candles on the table with her lighter. The four all sit down for dinner and Rachel's parents begin talking about the forest fire and the reports that it was arson. The conversation soon turns into an argument when Rachel's anger visibly increases throughout James's lecture. Chloe can either calm Rachel down or attack James on his misdeeds with her backtalk. Whichever option is chosen, Rachel will lose her temper and call James out. When Chloe and Rose join in the argument, Rachel begins to dissociate and eventually throws a salad bowl through the table, smashing it. She screams at James to tell her the truth. James tells her that the woman he kissed was not his mistress, but is in fact, Rachel's biological mother. The episode ends with scenes showing Steph at the hospital to see Drew and Mikey, Joyce embracing David in despair upon seeing that Chloe hasn't returned, Rachel's biological mother smoking a cigarette, Damon approaching Frank (how they will react depends on whether Chloe gave the money to Damon, Drew, or kept it), Victoria looking at a Tempest poster the dressing room before stepping on it and leaving, Samantha approaching Nathan, and the wildfire still happening in the distance.

45,45,0.26984,0.24818,45,45,"Then the viewfinder and the blackness disappear and Chloe and Rachel are again sitting on the couch across from James and Rose.
[EX]   JAMES : Chloe, I believe Rachel trusts you more than anyone else right now.
[EX]   S0 : CHOICE: (Won backtalk challenge with Frank)  [EX]   CHLOE : I need to find that woman from yesterday, Sera.","Continuing from the last episode where Chloe Price is at Rachel Amber's house for dinner when Rachel accuses her father of cheating, James Amber reveals that the woman he was with in the park was Rachel's real mother, Sera Gearhardt. He then tells them the whole story, in which Chloe and Rachel then find themselves in a dark area with a viewfinder. As James tells the story, they look through the viewfinder, which shows them visuals of how Sera and James met in high school and fell in love. They had a child together (Rachel) but Sera became a drug addict. Growing fearful of Sera's behavior, James eventually left with the child and made an agreement with Sera to pay her monthly if she agreed to stay away. This worked for 15 years. Rachel is devastated and wants to meet Sera, but has no idea how to find her before heading upstairs. Chloe agrees to help (against James's wishes) and goes to Rachel's room, where she finds Rachel laying in bed and is still upset with her father's lies. After using a flashlight from a toolbox and a star globe from a night light to form a starry night, Chloe is able to talk to Rachel, promising to help find Sera. Chloe then has another dream where she is onstage in her Ariel costume on some seats that are arranged to look like car seats. William is sitting in the front row of seats, acting like he is driving. He explains the reason why people keep secrets: to keep their loved ones safe. The dream ends with an actual truck appearing onstage and crushing William, causing Chloe to fall in depression while Victoria can be heard booing her. The next morning, she returns home (in which she may discover that David had searched through her room depending on decisions made in the previous episodes) and calls Frank Bowers, who reluctantly agrees to meet Chloe at the junkyard. While heading downstairs, she sees Joyce and David embracing each other. When she tries to sneak pass them, they see her. David reveals that he has decided to trust Chloe more if she stops taking drugs but despite this, Chloe still refuses to change. David then explains the reason while he's here: his friend Phil Becker had died during their last mission in the army, and he did not want Chloe to suffer the same pain that he had when he lost his friend and hands her a photo of him and Phil. Chloe can choose whether to take the picture or reject it, which will earn David's trust or anger. She then leaves for the junkyard taking her father's toolbox and an old repair manual with her. At the junkyard, Chloe fixes the old truck (requiring repairs on four parts of the engine) and uses a spark plug from the car that was formerly owned by William to finish the repairs. After taking the truck for a test drive, she continues to wait for Frank. Rachel shows up, as does Frank - but he isn't alone. Damon Merrick is here too and demands to know why Chloe is trying to find Sera. Through a conversation, Damon reveals that he knows Sera's whereabouts and learns that Rachel is James Amber's daughter. An altercation takes place (in which Chloe can give Damon the money she took from Drew and Mikey's room if she kept it) and Rachel attacks Damon with a wooden board and is then stabbed in the arm, shocking Chloe and Frank. Frank then hold back Damon while Chloe rushes Rachel to the hospital. Once there, two nurses quickly take her to surgery while Chloe stays in the waiting room. James and Amber later show up and when James asks Chloe what happened, she tearfully tells James the whole story. Chloe can then use this time to talk to Rose, Anthony North (Drew and Mikey's father), the couple from Episode 1, Steph, Drew, and Mikey (with the option of playing one last tabletop game with them). Rachel survives but still wants to find her mother. After James leaves them to talk, she convinces Chloe to break into her dad's office and gives her a code to disarm the alarm. Before leaving, she briefly speaks to Eliot Hampden. She can also eavesdrop on a conversation (or argument) that Samantha's mother is having with either Nathan or Sean in one of the rooms regarding Samantha's injury (presumed to be Nathan's doing). While at James's office, she finds a key hidden in a trophy and uses it to unlock a drawer, which contains evidence showing that James lied about a lot of things and that Damon has Sera. She contacts Damon using James's phone (who, in return, thinks she is James) and has her do some favors: destroy the evidence (which is a glove that Chloe must burn using her lighter and a trash can), finding the snitch (which has to be anyone other than Frank) and showing him the money he promised to give him (which is hidden behind some books on the bookshelf). After all this, he then reveals that Sera is held captive at the old mill. Before she can leave, she is caught by Eliot (who had followed Chloe from the hospital) and closes the door from behind, reactivating the alarm. An argument between the two begins, in which Eliot reveals that he strongly dislikes Rachel and wants Chloe all to himself, while Chloe backtalks against him while trying to call the police by pretending to agree with Eliot. If she wins the backtalk, the police will arrive and Chloe leaves while Eliot stays behind to confront the police. If she loses, Eliot will find out what she's up to, which will make Chloe set off the alarm, forcing Eliot to leave. After escaping, she drives to the old mill. After avoiding a logger truck, she stops near the burnt forest and will speak to an illusion of William, who convinces Chloe to keep going. After arriving at the old mill, she finds Frank's RV and heads into the mill. Optionally, she can find a knife in the mill to use as a weapon against Damon. Chloe confronts Damon, who has Sera tied up in a chair. He reveals that James is paying him to kill Sera and when Chloe tries to stop him, she gets knocked to the ground and is knocked unconscious by him. An injured Frank enters and struggles with Damon, presumably killing him afterwards as Frank got the better of him. Chloe wakes up and talks with Sera, who tries to convince her to not tell Rachel about anything that happened at the mill or her father's corruptive actions (while also believing that she can never be a good mother to Rachel and wishes for her to be with a father who loves her), knowing that it will cause more hurt to Rachel while Chloe tries to convince her to meet Rachel. After the conversation, Sera lets Chloe choose whether she should tell Rachel the truth or not. Chloe can also give Sera Rachel's bracelet if she has it, but she will give it back if Chloe didn't convince her. After Sera leaves, Chloe returns to the hospital and has to decide whether to lie to Rachel (which will cause her to make amends with James) or tell her everything (which will cause her to disown her father and sever ties with him for his wrongdoings). Regardless of her choice, she and Rachel remain friends at the end. The following scenes are then shown (which will all vary depending on Chloe's choices): 1. The Amber family either happily spending time with each other or in disarray. 2. Frank sitting by his RV holding a box of Damon's things. 3. Nathan and Samantha either spending time with each other or drifting apart (if Chloe wasn't supportive of them). 4. Chloe either embracing Joyce and David or still maintaining personal issues towards David. 5. Eliot, whose actions at the Amber house had led to him being expelled, preparing to leave Blackwell and will tear up a photograph of him and Chloe if she lost the backtalk. 6. Steph, Drew, and Mikey playing a tabletop game in front of Blackwell with one of the brothers still recovering from his injuries. The remaining scenes show Chloe and Rachel spending time together. While sitting near the lighthouse, Sera will show up if she was convinced by Chloe to meet Rachel. At the very end of the episode, in the final cinematic, the fate of Rachel Amber is suggested to be similar to that of Victoria and Max's from the first game, where Rachel's phone can be seen ringing inside the underground vault with Chloe being on the other line and the click of a camera can be heard in the background, implying that Rachel is photographed by either Nathan or Jefferson.

frank then hold back damon while chloe rushes rachel to the hospital .
once there , two nurses quickly take her to surgery while chloe stays in the waiting room .
james and amber later show up and when james asks chloe what happened , she tearfully tells james the whole story .
chloe can then use this time to talk to rose , anthony north ( drew and mikey 's father ) , the couple from episode 1 , steph , drew , and mikey ( with the option of playing one last tabletop game with them ) .
rachel survives but still wants to find her mother .
after james leaves them to talk , she convinces chloe to break into her dad 's office and gives her a code to disarm the alarm .
before leaving , she briefly speaks to eliot hampden .
she can also eavesdrop on a conversation ( or argument ) that samantha 's mother is having with either nathan or sean in one of the rooms regarding samantha 's injury ( presumed to be nathan 's doing ) .
while at james 's office , she finds a key hidden in a trophy and uses it to unlock a drawer , which contains evidence showing that james lied about a lot of things and that damon has sera .
she contacts damon using james 's phone ( who , in return , thinks she is james ) and has her do some favors : destroy the evidence ( which is a glove that chloe must burn using her lighter and a trash can ) , finding the snitch ( which has to be anyone other than frank ) and showing him the money he promised to give him ( which is hidden behind some books on the bookshelf ) .
after all this , he then reveals that sera is held captive at the old mill .
before she can leave , she is caught by eliot ( who had followed chloe from the hospital ) and closes the door from behind , reactivating the alarm .
an argument between the two begins , in which eliot reveals that he strongly dislikes rachel and wants chloe all to himself , while chloe backtalks against him while trying to call the police by pretending to agree with eliot .
if she wins the backtalk , the police will arrive and chloe leaves while eliot stays behind to confront the police .
if she loses , eliot will find out what she 's up to , which will make chloe set off the alarm , forcing eliot to leave .
after escaping , she drives to the old mill .
after avoiding a logger truck , she stops near the burnt forest and will speak to an illusion of william , who convinces chloe to keep going .
after arriving at the old mill , she finds frank 's rv and heads into the mill .
optionally , she can find a knife in the mill to use as a weapon against damon .
chloe confronts damon , who has sera tied up in a chair .
he reveals that james is paying him to kill sera and when chloe tries to stop him , she gets knocked to the ground and is knocked unconscious by him .
an injured frank enters and struggles with damon , presumably killing him afterwards as frank got the better of him .
chloe wakes up and talks with sera , who tries to convince her to not tell rachel about anything that happened at the mill or her father 's corruptive actions ( while also believing that she can never be a good mother to rachel and wishes for her to be with a father who loves her ) , knowing that it will cause more hurt to rachel while chloe tries to convince her to meet rachel .
after the conversation , sera lets chloe choose whether she should tell rachel the truth or not .
chloe can also give sera rachel 's bracelet if she has it , but she will give it back if chloe did n't convince her .
after sera leaves , chloe returns to the hospital and has to decide whether to lie to rachel ( which will cause her to make amends with james ) or tell her everything ( which will cause her to disown her father and sever ties with him for his wrongdoings ) .
regardless of her choice , she and rachel remain friends at the end .
the following scenes are then shown ( which will all vary depending on chloe 's choices ): 1 .

We 're about to play a brand - new track from PissHead , and if you have n't heard these guys yet , what I want you to do is crank that stereo up as loud as it goes .","Continuing from the last episode where Chloe Price is at Rachel Amber 's house for dinner when Rachel accuses her father of cheating , James Amber reveals that the woman he was with in the park was Rachel 's real mother , Sera Gearhardt .
He then tells them the whole story , in which Chloe and Rachel then find themselves in a dark area with a viewfinder .
As James tells the story , they look through the viewfinder , which shows them visuals of how Sera and James met in high school and fell in love .
They had a child together ( Rachel ) but Sera became a drug addict .
Growing fearful of Sera 's behavior , James eventually left with the child and made an agreement with Sera to pay her monthly if she agreed to stay away .
This worked for 15 years .
Rachel is devastated and wants to meet Sera , but has no idea how to find her before heading upstairs .
Chloe agrees to help ( against James 's wishes ) and goes to Rachel 's room , where she finds Rachel laying in bed and is still upset with her father 's lies .
After using a flashlight from a toolbox and a star globe from a night light to form a starry night , Chloe is able to talk to Rachel , promising to help find Sera .
Chloe then has another dream where she is onstage in her Ariel costume on some seats that are arranged to look like car seats .
William is sitting in the front row of seats , acting like he is driving .
He explains the reason why people keep secrets : to keep their loved ones safe .
The dream ends with an actual truck appearing onstage and crushing William , causing Chloe to fall in depression while Victoria can be heard booing her .
The next morning , she returns home ( in which she may discover that David had searched through her room depending on decisions made in the previous episodes ) and calls Frank Bowers , who reluctantly agrees to meet Chloe at the junkyard .
While heading downstairs , she sees Joyce and David embracing each other .
When she tries to sneak pass them , they see her .
David reveals that he has decided to trust Chloe more if she stops taking drugs but despite this , Chloe still refuses to change .
David then explains the reason while he 's here : his friend Phil Becker had died during their last mission in the army , and he did not want Chloe to suffer the same pain that he had when he lost his friend and hands her a photo of him and Phil .
Chloe can choose whether to take the picture or reject it , which will earn David 's trust or anger .
She then leaves for the junkyard taking her father 's toolbox and an old repair manual with her .
At the junkyard , Chloe fixes the old truck ( requiring repairs on four parts of the engine ) and uses a spark plug from the car that was formerly owned by William to finish the repairs .
After taking the truck for a test drive , she continues to wait for Frank .
Rachel shows up , as does Frank - but he is n't alone .
Damon Merrick is here too and demands to know why Chloe is trying to find Sera .

[EX]   S0 : CHOICE: (Saw the photo Rachel posted)  [EX]   CHLOE : People can eat a dick.
[EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Rachel looks awesome...","The episode starts with a hooded Chloe Price smoking a cigarette and standing at the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to come. After its passage, she takes off her hood and goes towards the old mill, ignoring the ""No Trespassing"" sign after jumping over a fence. In order to get inside the mill, she starts an argument with the bouncer, in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails. After entering, she can interact with people, objects, graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money (or not). If she steals the money, she'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later. After this, she'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys, the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her. However, she'll manage to see the band by going upstairs, even with the floor there being rotten. She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her. She's saved by Rachel Amber, in her very first appearance, and will have the first major choice of the game: attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing. After running downstairs, the two girls stop and look at Frank, who notices what's going to happen and quickly stops the guys, causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill. Rachel pulls Chloe along with her, and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night. The next morning, Chloe is shown waking up in her room, at the Price household. She sits up and takes her red 'Oregon' ashtray and starts smoking a cigarette (or weed, if she bought it from Frank earlier with the stolen money). Chloe can look at a photo of her and Max Caulfield as kids along with her dad, William Price and can also look at her diary. After being called by her mother, Joyce Price, for breakfast downstairs, she'll get up from her bed and will be able to interact with many objects around her room. She'll change clothes before leaving her room (the player gets to choose her outfit). Due to having drunk too much, Chloe notices her phone is missing. She then goes to her mother's room to call her phone with her mother's phone. There, she can interact with another object before using her mother's phone. By doing this, Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom, and just after she takes it, her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone, causing her to go back to the room. When she finally goes downstairs, she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on. She'll then talk with her mother about several topics, and at the end of the conversation, she'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels. Depending on her choice, Joyce will be either kind or tough towards her. Chloe'll have to pick the keys from her stepfather, David Madsen, and take them to him since he'll be taking her to school today. After leaving the house and going to David, he'll ask her to get the tools he needs to fix his car in the garage. After this, she gets in the car and David will try to start a conversation with her. She can either start a fight with him or listen to what he has to say. After the talk, Chloe will fall asleep and have a weird dream about being in a car with her dad, going to pick up her mom from the grocery store. The dream abruptly ends with a truck crashing through William's car. When she wakes up, she's already at Blackwell Academy. There, she can talk to Eliot Hampden (and choose whether or not she wants to watch The Tempest play with him), Victoria Chase (with the option of sabotaging her homework if doing so), Skip Matthews (with the option of listening to the demo of his band, PissHead, and giving him your opinion on it if doing so), Principal Wells (only if she sits on a crate on the stage and with the option of starting a backtalk challenge with him if doing so), Michelle Grant, Mikey North and Steph Gingrich (in order to get her DVD and with the additional option of playing a tabletop game with them), and other students. Afterwards, she'll go towards the school entrance, but she'll be interrupted by Drew North and Nathan Prescott, who are starting a fight. A student called Samantha Myers urges Chloe to do something to help Nathan, and Chloe can either backtalk Drew and defend Nathan or just ignore them, which will cause Samantha to either thank Chloe or be upset with her for not helping. When the fight is over, she can finally enter the school, and just as she opens the door, Rachel appears on the other side and pulls her along with her to the Drama Lab where Travis Keaton is rehearsing with Dana Ward and Hayden Jones. Rachel will ask for her opinion on Miranda's love for Fernando, both portrayed by Dana and Hayden respectively in ""The Tempest"" play, and Chloe can choose whether to say it's true love or not. After the class is over, everyone will leave the room, except for Chloe and Rachel. Rachel will change to normal clothes and ask Chloe to get her belt from her bag and bring it to her. After doing this, they'll have a short conversation before Rachel invites Chloe to skip school, and they end up in a train carriage where, after finding some crates to sit on, they play the game Two Truths and a Lie. Chloe can either cheat or follow the game rules. After their game, Chloe will have the option of sharing or not her earbuds with Rachel during their trip. Upon arriving at Overlook Park, they'll play another game using the viewfinders to spy on people around the park. However, the viewfinder that they intend to use it broken. Chloe asks Rachel for something sharp like a knife and she gives her a nail file, which Chloe uses to unscrew a deducation plate from a park bench and then uses it to break open the viewfinder, allowing them to use it for free. When they get a closer view of the last couple available, a man and a woman under a tree, Rachel gets distressed when they start kissing and puts an end to their game, telling Chloe she needs to get drunk. They'll then go to the other side of the park, where a couple is having a picnic and have a bottle of wine on their table. Rachel approaches the couple and starts acting sick, throwing herself to the ground and pretending to be in need of resuscitation. Chloe can encourage the man to help her, either succeeding or failing on doing so resulting in the man ""saving"" Rachel's life or the woman seeing through their ploy. Whatever the outcome is, the two girls will get the wine. After this, they're shown walking on the train tracks. Chloe invites Rachel to explore a junkyard nearby and Rachel lets her explore on her own. After a long conversation between the two, no matter what choices the player has made so far, Rachel will leave, but not before Chloe tries to convince her to stay. Chloe has the option to say that they have a real friendship or something more. Once Rachel leaves, Chloe gets angry and breaks everything around her. She then has a meltdown upon seeing her late father's car. She'll fall asleep and have another dream about her father, this time, with him advising/warning her on her relationship with Rachel, in which Chloe will see Rachel outside of the car, who will then catch fire. When she wakes up, it's already night and she goes back to the overlook where she finds Rachel. Upon a brief dialogue, in which Rachel reveals the man they had seen at the park was her dad, and that he was cheating on her mother with that woman. Rachel takes out a photo of her as a kid with her father, asks Chloe for her lighter which she uses it burn the photo, throwing it into a nearby trash bin, and starting a wildfire by kicking the bin into a tree nearby. Rachel then screams, increasing the fire's intensity. The episode ends showing each character's reaction to the wildfire seen in the sky.

[EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Rachel looks awesome...","The episode starts with a hooded Chloe Price smoking a cigarette and standing at the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to come. After its passage, she takes off her hood and goes towards the old mill, ignoring the ""No Trespassing"" sign after jumping over a fence. In order to get inside the mill, she starts an argument with the bouncer, in which she can win and be allowed inside or have to use the backdoor to get in if she fails. After entering, she can interact with people, objects, graffiti and even steal a shirt and some money (or not). If she steals the money, she'll have the option of buying weed from Frank Bowers or save the money for later. After this, she'll try to go through the crowd in order to see the band that's playing and ends up bumping into two skeevy guys, the taller one being somewhat aggressive towards her. However, she'll manage to see the band by going upstairs, even with the floor there being rotten. She enjoys the music for a while until the two guys from before appear and confront her. She's saved by Rachel Amber, in her very first appearance, and will have the first major choice of the game: attack one of the guys or run without doing nothing. After running downstairs, the two girls stop and look at Frank, who notices what's going to happen and quickly stops the guys, causing both of them to get angry and leave the mill. Rachel pulls Chloe along with her, and they enjoy the Firewalk show for the rest of the night. The next morning, Chloe is shown waking up in her room, at the Price household. She sits up and takes her red 'Oregon' ashtray and starts smoking a cigarette (or weed, if she bought it from Frank earlier with the stolen money). Chloe can look at a photo of her and Max Caulfield as kids along with her dad, William Price and can also look at her diary. After being called by her mother, Joyce Price, for breakfast downstairs, she'll get up from her bed and will be able to interact with many objects around her room. She'll change clothes before leaving her room (the player gets to choose her outfit). Due to having drunk too much, Chloe notices her phone is missing. She then goes to her mother's room to call her phone with her mother's phone. There, she can interact with another object before using her mother's phone. By doing this, Chloe finds her phone in the bathroom, and just after she takes it, her mother asks her from downstairs to bring her purse along with her phone, causing her to go back to the room. When she finally goes downstairs, she can interact with the objects around the living room and even get some information that can be used later on. She'll then talk with her mother about several topics, and at the end of the conversation, she'll have to choose between being comprehensive towards Joyce or saying how she actually feels. Depending on her choice, Joyce will be either kind or tough towards her. Chloe'll have to pick the keys from her stepfather, David Madsen, and take them to him since he'll be taking her to school today. After leaving the house and going to David, he'll ask her to get the tools he needs to fix his car in the garage. After this, she gets in the car and David will try to start a conversation with her. She can either start a fight with him or listen to what he has to say. After the talk, Chloe will fall asleep and have a weird dream about being in a car with her dad, going to pick up her mom from the grocery store.

[EX]   S0 : CHOICE: (Gave money to Damon)  [EX]   CHLOE : (thinking) Plus he likes me, and he owes me one from yesterday.
[EX]   S0 : CHOICE: (Won backtalk challenge with Frank)  [EX]   CHLOE : I need to find that woman from yesterday, Sera.","Continuing from the last episode where Chloe Price is at Rachel Amber's house for dinner when Rachel accuses her father of cheating, James Amber reveals that the woman he was with in the park was Rachel's real mother, Sera Gearhardt. He then tells them the whole story, in which Chloe and Rachel then find themselves in a dark area with a viewfinder. As James tells the story, they look through the viewfinder, which shows them visuals of how Sera and James met in high school and fell in love. They had a child together (Rachel) but Sera became a drug addict. Growing fearful of Sera's behavior, James eventually left with the child and made an agreement with Sera to pay her monthly if she agreed to stay away. This worked for 15 years. Rachel is devastated and wants to meet Sera, but has no idea how to find her before heading upstairs. Chloe agrees to help (against James's wishes) and goes to Rachel's room, where she finds Rachel laying in bed and is still upset with her father's lies. After using a flashlight from a toolbox and a star globe from a night light to form a starry night, Chloe is able to talk to Rachel, promising to help find Sera. Chloe then has another dream where she is onstage in her Ariel costume on some seats that are arranged to look like car seats. William is sitting in the front row of seats, acting like he is driving. He explains the reason why people keep secrets: to keep their loved ones safe. The dream ends with an actual truck appearing onstage and crushing William, causing Chloe to fall in depression while Victoria can be heard booing her. The next morning, she returns home (in which she may discover that David had searched through her room depending on decisions made in the previous episodes) and calls Frank Bowers, who reluctantly agrees to meet Chloe at the junkyard. While heading downstairs, she sees Joyce and David embracing each other. When she tries to sneak pass them, they see her. David reveals that he has decided to trust Chloe more if she stops taking drugs but despite this, Chloe still refuses to change. David then explains the reason while he's here: his friend Phil Becker had died during their last mission in the army, and he did not want Chloe to suffer the same pain that he had when he lost his friend and hands her a photo of him and Phil. Chloe can choose whether to take the picture or reject it, which will earn David's trust or anger. She then leaves for the junkyard taking her father's toolbox and an old repair manual with her. At the junkyard, Chloe fixes the old truck (requiring repairs on four parts of the engine) and uses a spark plug from the car that was formerly owned by William to finish the repairs. After taking the truck for a test drive, she continues to wait for Frank. Rachel shows up, as does Frank - but he isn't alone. Damon Merrick is here too and demands to know why Chloe is trying to find Sera. Through a conversation, Damon reveals that he knows Sera's whereabouts and learns that Rachel is James Amber's daughter. An altercation takes place (in which Chloe can give Damon the money she took from Drew and Mikey's room if she kept it) and Rachel attacks Damon with a wooden board and is then stabbed in the arm, shocking Chloe and Frank. Frank then hold back Damon while Chloe rushes Rachel to the hospital. Once there, two nurses quickly take her to surgery while Chloe stays in the waiting room. James and Amber later show up and when James asks Chloe what happened, she tearfully tells James the whole story. Chloe can then use this time to talk to Rose, Anthony North (Drew and Mikey's father), the couple from Episode 1, Steph, Drew, and Mikey (with the option of playing one last tabletop game with them). Rachel survives but still wants to find her mother. After James leaves them to talk, she convinces Chloe to break into her dad's office and gives her a code to disarm the alarm. Before leaving, she briefly speaks to Eliot Hampden. She can also eavesdrop on a conversation (or argument) that Samantha's mother is having with either Nathan or Sean in one of the rooms regarding Samantha's injury (presumed to be Nathan's doing). While at James's office, she finds a key hidden in a trophy and uses it to unlock a drawer, which contains evidence showing that James lied about a lot of things and that Damon has Sera. She contacts Damon using James's phone (who, in return, thinks she is James) and has her do some favors: destroy the evidence (which is a glove that Chloe must burn using her lighter and a trash can), finding the snitch (which has to be anyone other than Frank) and showing him the money he promised to give him (which is hidden behind some books on the bookshelf). After all this, he then reveals that Sera is held captive at the old mill. Before she can leave, she is caught by Eliot (who had followed Chloe from the hospital) and closes the door from behind, reactivating the alarm. An argument between the two begins, in which Eliot reveals that he strongly dislikes Rachel and wants Chloe all to himself, while Chloe backtalks against him while trying to call the police by pretending to agree with Eliot. If she wins the backtalk, the police will arrive and Chloe leaves while Eliot stays behind to confront the police. If she loses, Eliot will find out what she's up to, which will make Chloe set off the alarm, forcing Eliot to leave. After escaping, she drives to the old mill. After avoiding a logger truck, she stops near the burnt forest and will speak to an illusion of William, who convinces Chloe to keep going. After arriving at the old mill, she finds Frank's RV and heads into the mill. Optionally, she can find a knife in the mill to use as a weapon against Damon. Chloe confronts Damon, who has Sera tied up in a chair. He reveals that James is paying him to kill Sera and when Chloe tries to stop him, she gets knocked to the ground and is knocked unconscious by him. An injured Frank enters and struggles with Damon, presumably killing him afterwards as Frank got the better of him. Chloe wakes up and talks with Sera, who tries to convince her to not tell Rachel about anything that happened at the mill or her father's corruptive actions (while also believing that she can never be a good mother to Rachel and wishes for her to be with a father who loves her), knowing that it will cause more hurt to Rachel while Chloe tries to convince her to meet Rachel. After the conversation, Sera lets Chloe choose whether she should tell Rachel the truth or not. Chloe can also give Sera Rachel's bracelet if she has it, but she will give it back if Chloe didn't convince her. After Sera leaves, Chloe returns to the hospital and has to decide whether to lie to Rachel (which will cause her to make amends with James) or tell her everything (which will cause her to disown her father and sever ties with him for his wrongdoings). Regardless of her choice, she and Rachel remain friends at the end. The following scenes are then shown (which will all vary depending on Chloe's choices): 1. The Amber family either happily spending time with each other or in disarray. 2. Frank sitting by his RV holding a box of Damon's things. 3. Nathan and Samantha either spending time with each other or drifting apart (if Chloe wasn't supportive of them). 4. Chloe either embracing Joyce and David or still maintaining personal issues towards David. 5. Eliot, whose actions at the Amber house had led to him being expelled, preparing to leave Blackwell and will tear up a photograph of him and Chloe if she lost the backtalk. 6. Steph, Drew, and Mikey playing a tabletop game in front of Blackwell with one of the brothers still recovering from his injuries. The remaining scenes show Chloe and Rachel spending time together. While sitting near the lighthouse, Sera will show up if she was convinced by Chloe to meet Rachel. At the very end of the episode, in the final cinematic, the fate of Rachel Amber is suggested to be similar to that of Victoria and Max's from the first game, where Rachel's phone can be seen ringing inside the underground vault with Chloe being on the other line and the click of a camera can be heard in the background, implying that Rachel is photographed by either Nathan or Jefferson.

","David , Joyce , Wells , Victoria , James , Rose , and the raven are sitting in the audience , most of them with their arms crossed .
We 're about to play a brand - new track from PissHead , and if you have n't heard these guys yet , what I want you to do is crank that stereo up as loud as it goes .
To unlock the "" Leave it be "" option , Chloe must walk away , then try to steal the pudding again , and Drew takes it out of her hands .","Continuing from the last episode where Chloe Price is at Rachel Amber 's house for dinner when Rachel accuses her father of cheating , James Amber reveals that the woman he was with in the park was Rachel 's real mother , Sera Gearhardt .
He then tells them the whole story , in which Chloe and Rachel then find themselves in a dark area with a viewfinder .
As James tells the story , they look through the viewfinder , which shows them visuals of how Sera and James met in high school and fell in love .
They had a child together ( Rachel ) but Sera became a drug addict .
Growing fearful of Sera 's behavior , James eventually left with the child and made an agreement with Sera to pay her monthly if she agreed to stay away .
This worked for 15 years .
Rachel is devastated and wants to meet Sera , but has no idea how to find her before heading upstairs .
Chloe agrees to help ( against James 's wishes ) and goes to Rachel 's room , where she finds Rachel laying in bed and is still upset with her father 's lies .
After using a flashlight from a toolbox and a star globe from a night light to form a starry night , Chloe is able to talk to Rachel , promising to help find Sera .
Chloe then has another dream where she is onstage in her Ariel costume on some seats that are arranged to look like car seats .
William is sitting in the front row of seats , acting like he is driving .
He explains the reason why people keep secrets : to keep their loved ones safe .
The dream ends with an actual truck appearing onstage and crushing William , causing Chloe to fall in depression while Victoria can be heard booing her .
The next morning , she returns home ( in which she may discover that David had searched through her room depending on decisions made in the previous episodes ) and calls Frank Bowers , who reluctantly agrees to meet Chloe at the junkyard .
While heading downstairs , she sees Joyce and David embracing each other .
When she tries to sneak pass them , they see her .
David reveals that he has decided to trust Chloe more if she stops taking drugs but despite this , Chloe still refuses to change .
David then explains the reason while he 's here : his friend Phil Becker had died during their last mission in the army , and he did not want Chloe to suffer the same pain that he had when he lost his friend and hands her a photo of him and Phil .
Chloe can choose whether to take the picture or reject it , which will earn David 's trust or anger .
She then leaves for the junkyard taking her father 's toolbox and an old repair manual with her .
At the junkyard , Chloe fixes the old truck ( requiring repairs on four parts of the engine ) and uses a spark plug from the car that was formerly owned by William to finish the repairs .
After taking the truck for a test drive , she continues to wait for Frank .
Rachel shows up , as does Frank - but he is n't alone .
Damon Merrick is here too and demands to know why Chloe is trying to find Sera .
Through a conversation , Damon reveals that he knows Sera 's whereabouts and learns that Rachel is James Amber 's daughter .
An altercation takes place ( in which Chloe can give Damon the money she took from Drew and Mikey 's room if she kept it ) and Rachel attacks Damon with a wooden board and is then stabbed in the arm , shocking Chloe and Frank .
Frank then hold back Damon while Chloe rushes Rachel to the hospital .
Once there , two nurses quickly take her to surgery while Chloe stays in the waiting room .
James and Amber later show up and when James asks Chloe what happened , she tearfully tells James the whole story .
Chloe can then use this time to talk to Rose , Anthony North ( Drew and Mikey 's father ) , the couple from Episode 1 , Steph , Drew , and Mikey ( with the option of playing one last tabletop game with them ) .
Rachel survives but still wants to find her mother .
After James leaves them to talk , she convinces Chloe to break into her dad 's office and gives her a code to disarm the alarm .
Before leaving , she briefly speaks to Eliot Hampden .
She can also eavesdrop on a conversation ( or argument ) that Samantha 's mother is having with either Nathan or Sean in one of the rooms regarding Samantha 's injury ( presumed to be Nathan 's doing ) .
While at James 's office , she finds a key hidden in a trophy and uses it to unlock a drawer , which contains evidence showing that James lied about a lot of things and that Damon has Sera .
She contacts Damon using James 's phone ( who , in return , thinks she is James ) and has her do some favors : destroy the evidence ( which is a glove that Chloe must burn using her lighter and a trash can ) , finding the snitch ( which has to be anyone other than Frank ) and showing him the money he promised to give him ( which is hidden behind some books on the bookshelf ) .
After all this , he then reveals that Sera is held captive at the old mill .
Before she can leave , she is caught by Eliot ( who had followed Chloe from the hospital ) and closes the door from behind , reactivating the alarm .
An argument between the two begins , in which Eliot reveals that he strongly dislikes Rachel and wants Chloe all to himself , while Chloe backtalks against him while trying to call the police by pretending to agree with Eliot .
If she wins the backtalk , the police will arrive and Chloe leaves while Eliot stays behind to confront the police .
If she loses , Eliot will find out what she 's up to , which will make Chloe set off the alarm , forcing Eliot to leave .
After escaping , she drives to the old mill .
After avoiding a logger truck , she stops near the burnt forest and will speak to an illusion of William , who convinces Chloe to keep going .
After arriving at the old mill , she finds Frank 's RV and heads into the mill .
Optionally , she can find a knife in the mill to use as a weapon against Damon .
Chloe confronts Damon , who has Sera tied up in a chair .
He reveals that James is paying him to kill Sera and when Chloe tries to stop him , she gets knocked to the ground and is knocked unconscious by him .
An injured Frank enters and struggles with Damon , presumably killing him afterwards as Frank got the better of him .
Chloe wakes up and talks with Sera , who tries to convince her to not tell Rachel about anything that happened at the mill or her father 's corruptive actions ( while also believing that she can never be a good mother to Rachel and wishes for her to be with a father who loves her ) , knowing that it will cause more hurt to Rachel while Chloe tries to convince her to meet Rachel .
After the conversation , Sera lets Chloe choose whether she should tell Rachel the truth or not .
Chloe can also give Sera Rachel 's bracelet if she has it , but she will give it back if Chloe did n't convince her .
After Sera leaves , Chloe returns to the hospital and has to decide whether to lie to Rachel ( which will cause her to make amends with James ) or tell her everything ( which will cause her to disown her father and sever ties with him for his wrongdoings ) .
